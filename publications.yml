- abstract: Excessive fetal growth is associated with DNA methylation
    alterations in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC),
    but their functional impact remains elusive. We implemented an
    integrative analysis combining single-cell epigenomics, single-cell
    transcriptomics, and in vitro analyses to functionally link DNA
    methylation changes to putative alterations of HSPC functions. We
    showed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from large for gestational
    age neonates that both DNA hypermethylation and chromatin
    rearrangements target a specific network of transcription factors
    known to sustain stem cell quiescence. In parallel, we found a
    decreased expression of key genes regulating HSC differentiation
    including EGR1, KLF2, SOCS3, and JUNB. Our functional analyses
    showed that this epigenetic programming was associated with a
    decreased ability for HSCs to remain quiescent. Taken together, our
    multimodal approach using single-cell (epi)genomics showed that
    human fetal overgrowth affects hematopoietic stem cells' quiescence
    signaling via epigenetic programming.

- abstract: "Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated
    with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse perinatal
    outcomes. GDM often reoccurs and is associated with increased risk
    of subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To improve our
    understanding of the aetiological factors and molecular processes
    driving the occurrence of GDM, including the extent to which these
    overlap with T2D pathophysiology, the GENetics of Diabetes In
    Pregnancy Consortium assembled genome-wide association studies of
    diverse ancestry in a total of 5485 women with GDM and 347 856
    without GDM. Through multi-ancestry meta-analysis, we identified
    five loci with genome-wide significant association (P &lt; 5 × 10−8)
    with GDM, mapping to/near MTNR1B (P = 4.3 × 10−54), TCF7L2
    (P = 4.0 × 10−16), CDKAL1 (P = 1.6 × 10−14), CDKN2A-CDKN2B
    (P = 4.1 × 10−9) and HKDC1 (P = 2.9 × 10−8). Multiple lines of
    evidence pointed to the shared pathophysiology of GDM and T2D: (i)
    four of the five GDM loci (not HKDC1) have been previously reported
    at genome-wide significance for T2D; (ii) significant enrichment for
    associations with GDM at previously reported T2D loci; (iii) strong
    genetic correlation between GDM and T2D and (iv) enrichment of GDM
    associations mapping to genomic annotations in diabetes-relevant
    tissues and transcription factor binding sites. Mendelian
    randomization analyses demonstrated significant causal association
    (5% false discovery rate) of higher body mass index on increased GDM
    risk. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that GDM and
    T2D are part of the same underlying pathology but that, as

- abstract: OBJECTIVE Maternal glycemic dysregulation during pregnancy
    increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in her offspring, a
    risk thought to be linearly related to maternal hyperglycemia. It is
    hypothesized that changes in offspring DNA methylation (DNAm)
    underline these associations.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To address
    this hypothesis, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of
    epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from eight birth
    cohorts investigating relationships between cord blood DNAm and
    fetal exposure to maternal glucose (Nmaximum = 3,503), insulin
    (Nmaximum = 2,062), and area under the curve of glucose (AUCgluc)
    following oral glucose tolerance tests (Nmaximum = 1,505). We
    performed lookup analyses for identified cytosine-guanine
    dinucleotides (CpGs) in independent observational cohorts to examine
    associations between DNAm and cardiometabolic traits as well as
    tissue-specific gene expression.RESULTS Greater maternal AUCgluc was
    associated with lower cord blood DNAm at neighboring CpGs cg26974062
    (β \[SE\] −0.013 \[2.1 × 10−3\], P value corrected for false
    discovery rate \[PFDR\] = 5.1 × 10−3) and cg02988288 (β \[SE\]−0.013
    \[2.3 × 10−3\], PFDR = 0.031) in TXNIP. These associations were
    attenuated in women with GDM. Lower blood DNAm at these two CpGs
    near TXNIP was associated with multiple metabolic traits later in
    life, including type 2 diabetes. TXNIP DNAm in liver biopsies was
    associated with hepatic expression of TXNIP. We observed little
    evidence of associations between either maternal glucose or insulin
    and cord blood DNAm.CONCLUSIONS Maternal hyperglycemia, as reflected
    by AUCgluc, was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at TXNIP.
    Associations between DNAm at these CpGs and metabolic traits in
    subsequent lookup analyses suggest that these may be candidate loci
    to investigate in future causal and mediation analyses.

- abstract: Recent advances in genetic analysis have significantly
    helped in progressively attenuating the heritability gap of obesity
    and have brought into focus monogenic variants that disrupt the
    melanocortin signaling. In a previous study, next-generation
    sequencing revealed a monogenic etiology in ∼50% of the children
    with severe obesity from a consanguineous population in Pakistan.
    Here we assess rare variants in obesity-causing genes in young
    adults with severe obesity from the same region. Genomic DNA from
    126 randomly selected young adult obese subjects (BMI 37.2 ± 0.3
    kg/m2; age 18.4 ± 0.3 years) was screened by conventional or
    augmented whole-exome analysis for point mutations and copy number
    variants (CNVs). Leptin, insulin, and cortisol levels were measured
    by ELISA. We identified 13 subjects carrying 13 different pathogenic
    or likely pathogenic variants in LEPR, PCSK1, MC4R, NTRK2, POMC,
    SH2B1, and SIM1. We also identified for the first time in the human,
    two homozygous stop-gain mutations in ASNSD1 and IFI16 genes.
    Inactivation of these genes in mouse models has been shown to result
    in obesity. Additionally, we describe nine homozygous mutations
    (seven missense, one stop-gain, and one stop-loss) and four
    copy-loss CNVs in genes or genomic regions previously linked to
    obesity-associated traits by genome-wide association studies.
    Unexpectedly, in contrast to obese children, pathogenic mutations in
    LEP and LEPR were either absent or rare in this cohort of young
    adults. High morbidity and mortality risks and social disadvantage
    of children with LEP or LEPR deficiency may in part explain this
    difference between the two cohorts.

- abstract: "AbstractThe hepatokine follistatin is elevated in patients
    with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and promotes hyperglycemia in mice. Here
    we explore the relationship of plasma follistatin levels with
    incident T2D and mechanisms involved. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per
    standard deviation (SD) increase in follistatin levels for T2D is
    1.24 (CI: 1.04--1.47, p  \\<\\< 0.05) during 19-year follow-up ( n
     = 4060, Sweden); and 1.31 (CI: 1.09--1.58, p  \\<\\< 0.01) during
    4-year follow-up ( n  = 883, Finland). High circulating follistatin
    associates with adipose tissue insulin resistance and non-alcoholic
    fatty liver disease ( n  = 210, Germany). In human adipocytes,
    follistatin dose-dependently increases free fatty acid release. In
    genome-wide association study (GWAS), variation in the glucokinase
    regulatory protein gene ( GCKR ) associates with plasma follistatin
    levels ( n  = 4239, Sweden; n  = 885, UK, Italy and Sweden) and GCKR
    regulates follistatin secretion in hepatocytes in vitro. Our
    findings suggest that GCKR regulates follistatin secretion and that
    elevated circulating follistatin associates with an increased risk
    of T2D by inducing adipose tissue insulin resistance."

- abstract: OBJECTIVE Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated
    with an increased risk of obesity and insulin resistance in
    offspring later in life, which might be explained by epigenetic
    changes in response to maternal hyperglycemic exposure.RESEARCH
    DESIGN AND METHODS We explored the association between GDM exposure
    and maternal blood and newborn cord blood methylation in 536
    mother-offspring pairs from the prospective FinnGeDi cohort using
    Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip arrays. We assessed two
    hypotheses. First, we tested for shared maternal and offspring
    epigenetic effects resulting from GDM exposure. Second, we tested
    whether GDM exposure and maternal methylation had an epigenetic
    effect on the offspring.RESULTS We did not find any epigenetic marks
    (differentially methylated CpG probes) with shared and consistent
    effects between mothers and offspring. After including maternal
    methylation in the model, we identified a single significant (false
    discovery rate 1.38 × 10−2) CpG at the cg22790973 probe (TFCP2)
    associated with GDM. We identified seven additional FDR-significant
    interactions of maternal methylation and GDM status, with the
    strongest association at the same cg22790973 probe (TFCP2), as well

- abstract: Hyperactive SHP2 promotes inflammation-driven insulin
    resistance by skewing macrophage balance in metabolic tissues and
    may be a target in T2D. , Inflaming insulin resistancePatients with
    the developmental disorder Noonan syndrome (NS) may be prone to
    insulin resistance. Studying the hyperactivation of tyrosine
    phosphatase SHP2 associated with this disease, Paccoud et al . now
    pinpoint an inflammatory origin of insulin resistance.
    Hyperactivation of SHP2 associated with glucose intolerance and
    insulin resistance in patients with NS. In a hyperactive SHP2 mouse
    model, bone marrow--derived and liver-resident macrophages shifted
    toward a proinflammatory profile, leading to altered systemic
    glucose homeostasis. Small-molecule targeting of SHP2 in wild-type
    diet-induced obese mice reduced inflammation in metabolic tissues
    and improved insulin sensitivity, hinting at the potential of
    targeting SHP2 for metabolic syndrome., Insulin resistance is a key
    event in type 2 diabetes onset and a major comorbidity of obesity.
    It results from a combination of fat excess--triggered defects,
    including lipotoxicity and metaflammation, but the causal mechanisms
    remain difficult to identify. Here, we report that hyperactivation
    of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 found in Noonan syndrome (NS) led
    to an unsuspected insulin resistance profile uncoupled from altered
    lipid management (for example, obesity or ectopic lipid deposits) in
    both patients and mice. Functional exploration of an NS mouse model
    revealed this insulin resistance phenotype correlated with
    constitutive inflammation of tissues involved in the regulation of
    glucose metabolism. Bone marrow transplantation and macrophage
    depletion improved glucose homeostasis and decreased metaflammation
    in the mice, highlighting a key role of macrophages. In-depth
    analysis of bone marrow--derived macrophages in vitro and liver
    macrophages showed that hyperactive SHP2 promoted a proinflammatory
    phenotype, modified resident macrophage homeostasis, and triggered
    monocyte infiltration. Consistent with a role of SHP2 in promoting
    inflammation-driven insulin resistance, pharmaceutical SHP2
    inhibition in obese diabetic mice improved insulin sensitivity even
    better than conventional antidiabetic molecules by specifically
    reducing metaflammation and alleviating macrophage activation.
    Together, these results reveal that SHP2 hyperactivation leads to
    inflammation-triggered metabolic impairments and highlight the
    therapeutical potential of SHP2 inhibition to ameliorate insulin
    resistance.

- abstract: AbstractBackground Adipogenesis, the process whereby
    preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes, is crucial for
    maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Cholesterol-lowering statins
    increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk possibly by affecting
    adipogenesis and insulin resistance but the (epi)genetic mechanisms
    involved are unknown. Here, we characterised the effects of statin
    treatment on adipocyte differentiation using in vitro human
    preadipocyte cell model to identify putative effective
    genes.ResultsStatin treatment during adipocyte differentiation
    caused a reduction in key genes involved in adipogenesis, such as
    ADIPOQ , GLUT4 and ABCG1. Using Illumina's Infinium '850K'850K
    Methylation EPIC array, we found a significant hypomethylation of
    cg14566882, located in the promoter of the histone deacetylase 9 (
    HDAC9) gene, in response to two types of statins (atorvastatin and
    mevastatin), which correlates with an increased HDAC9 mRNA
    expression. We confirmed that HDAC9 is a transcriptional repressor
    of the cholesterol efflux ABCG1 gene expression, which is
    epigenetically modified in obesity and prediabetic states. Thus, we
    assessed the putative impact of ABCG1 knockdown in mimicking the
    effect of statin in adipogenesis. ABCG1 KD reduced the expression of
    key genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and decreased
    insulin signalling and glucose uptake. In human blood cells from two
    cohorts, ABCG1 expression was impaired in response to statins,
    confirming that ABCG1 is targeted in vivo by these drugs.Conclusions
    We identified an epigenetic link between adipogenesis and adipose
    tissue insulin resistance in the context of T2D risk associated with
    statin use, which has important implications as HDAC9 and ABCG1 are
    considered potential therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic
    diseases.

- abstract: "AbstractSummary The NanoStringTM nCounter® is a platform
    for the targeted quantification of expression data in biofluids and
    tissues. While software by the manufacturer is available in addition
    to third parties packages, they do not provide a complete quality
    control (QC) pipeline. Here, we present NACHO ('NAnostring quality
    Control dasHbOard'NAnostring quality Control dasHbOard), a
    comprehensive QC R-package. The package consists of three subsequent
    steps: summarize, visualize and normalize. The summarize function
    collects all the relevant data and stores it in a tidy format, the
    visualize function initiates a dashboard with plots of the relevant
    QC outcomes. It contains QC metrics that are measured by default by
    the manufacturer, but also calculates other insightful measures,
    including the scaling factors that are needed in the normalization
    step. In this normalization step, different normalization methods
    can be chosen to optimally preprocess data. Together, NACHO is a
    comprehensive method that optimizes insight and preprocessing of
    nCounter® data.Availability and implementation NACHO is available as
    an R-package on CRAN and the development version on GitHub
    https://github.com/mcanouil/NACHO.Supplementary information
    Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

- abstract: Abstract Although hundreds of genome-wide association
    studies-implicated loci have been reported for adult obesity-related
    traits, less is known about the genetics specific for early-onset
    obesity and with only a few studies conducted in non-European
    populations to date. Searching for additional genetic variants
    associated with childhood obesity, we performed a trans-ancestral
    meta-analysis of 30 studies consisting of up to 13 005 cases (≥95th
    percentile of body mass index (BMI) achieved 2--18 years old) and
    15 599 controls (consistently &lt;50th percentile of BMI) of
    European, African, North/South American and East Asian ancestry.
    Suggestive loci were taken forward for replication in a sample of
    1888 cases and 4689 controls from seven cohorts of European and
    North/South American ancestry. In addition to observing 18
    previously implicated BMI or obesity loci, for both early and late
    onset, we uncovered one completely novel locus in this
    trans-ancestral analysis (nearest gene, METTL15). The variant was
    nominally associated with only the European subgroup analysis but
    had a consistent direction of effect in other ethnicities. We then
    utilized trans-ancestral Bayesian analysis to narrow down the
    location of the probable causal variant at each genome-wide
    significant signal. Of all the fine-mapped loci, we were able to
    narrow down the causative variant at four known loci to fewer than
    10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FAIM2, GNPDA2, MC4R and
    SEC16B loci). In conclusion, an ethnically diverse setting has
    enabled us to both identify an additional pediatric obesity locus
    and further fine-map existing loci.

- abstract: AbstractType 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the health of millions
    of people worldwide. The identification of genetic determinants
    associated with changes in glycemia over time might illuminate
    biological features that precede the development of T2D. Here we
    conducted a genome-wide association study of longitudinal fasting
    glucose changes in up to 13,807 non-diabetic individuals of European
    descent from nine cohorts. Fasting glucose change over time was
    defined as the slope of the line defined by multiple fasting glucose
    measurements obtained over up to 14 years of observation. We tested
    for associations of genetic variants with inverse-normal transformed
    fasting glucose change over time adjusting for age at baseline, sex,
    and principal components of genetic variation. We found no
    genome-wide significant association (P \<\< 5 × 10 −8 ) with fasting
    glucose change over time. Seven loci previously associated with T2D,
    fasting glucose or HbA1c were nominally (P \<\< 0.05) associated
    with fasting glucose change over time. Limited power influences
    unambiguous interpretation, but these data suggest that genetic
    effects on fasting glucose change over time are likely to be small.
    A public version of the data provides a genomic resource to combine
    with future studies to evaluate shared genetic links with T2D and
    other metabolic risk traits.

- abstract: Abstract Elevated blood pressure (BP), a leading cause of
    global morbidity and mortality, is influenced by both genetic and
    lifestyle factors. Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor.
    Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene--smoking
    interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure
    (PP) in 129 913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in
    480 178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci
    significantly associated with MAP and/or PP. Of these, 61 were
    previously published through main-effect analysis of BP traits, 37
    were recently reported by us for systolic BP and/or diastolic BP
    through gene--smoking interaction analysis and 38 were newly
    identified (P \< 5 × 10−8, false discovery rate \< 0.05). We also
    identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8
    showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include
    CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the
    spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show
    biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation. SLC26A7 encodes a
    chloride/bicarbonate exchanger expressed in the renal outer
    medullary collecting duct. AVPR1A is widely expressed, including in
    vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, myocardium and brain. FHAD1 is
    a long non-coding RNA overexpressed in heart failure. TMEM51 was
    associated with contractile function in cardiomyocytes. CASP9 plays
    a central role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Identified only in
    African ancestry were 30 novel loci. Our findings highlight the
    value of multi-ancestry investigations, particularly in studies of
    interaction with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle
    differences may contribute to novel findings.

- abstract: AbstractMany genetic loci affect circulating lipid levels,
    but it remains unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical
    activity, modify these genetic effects. To identify lipid loci
    interacting with physical activity, we performed genome-wide
    analyses of circulating HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and
    triglyceride levels in up to 120,979 individuals of European,
    African, Asian, Hispanic, and Brazilian ancestry, with follow-up of
    suggestive associations in an additional 131,012 individuals. We
    find four loci, in/near CLASP1 , LHX1 , SNTA1 , and CNTNAP2 , that
    are associated with circulating lipid levels through interaction
    with physical activity; higher levels of physical activity enhance
    the HDL cholesterol-increasing effects of the CLASP1 , LHX1 , and
    SNTA1 loci and attenuate the LDL cholesterol-increasing effect of
    the CNTNAP2 locus. The CLASP1 , LHX1 , and SNTA1 regions harbor
    genes linked to muscle function and lipid metabolism. Our results
    elucidate the role of physical activity interactions in the genetic
    contribution to blood lipid levels.

- abstract: Connecting melatonin receptor variants to signaling
    differences reveals paths to type 2 diabetes therapy. , Melatonin
    meets diabetesSome of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated
    with type 2 diabetes (T2D) occur in the gene encoding the melatonin
    receptor MT 2 , a G protein--coupled receptor (GPCR). Karamitri et
    al . measured the spontaneous and melatonin-stimulated signaling of
    40 different MT 2 variants. Computational analysis of these
    signaling profiles and assessment of genetic association data showed
    that those MT 2 variants with defective melatonin-stimulated G
    protein signaling and reduced spontaneous β-arrestin recruitment
    were associated with the greatest risk for T2D. These data may aid
    in the development of specific treatments for T2D depending on the
    patient's MT 2 variant. Moreover, the experimental approach may be
    applied to assess the impact of other GPCR mutations on disease
    associations.,Melatonin is produced during the night and regulates
    sleep and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in MTNR1B ,
    which encodes the melatonin receptor MT 2 , a G protein--coupled
    receptor (GPCR), are associated with an increased risk of type 2
    diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling
    pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 MT 2 variants by
    monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and melatonin-induced
    activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association
    analysis showed that defects in the melatonin-induced activation of
    Gα i1 and Gα z proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment
    to MT 2 were the most statistically significantly associated with an
    increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in
    silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the
    measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive
    tool for future studies on GPCR variants. Together, this large-scale
    functional study provides an operational framework for the
    postgenomic analysis of the multiple GPCR variants present in the
    human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling
    pathway--specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific
    personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential
    relevance of MT 2 function during the day, when melatonin is
    undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.

- abstract: In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is
    strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
    In this study, we hypothesized that the DNA methylome of livers from
    patients with T2D compared with livers of individuals with normal
    plasma glucose levels can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin
    resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and
    transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found
    that hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA (encoding
    platelet-derived growth factor α) and PDGFA overexpression are both
    associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased
    insulin resistance, and increased steatohepatitis risk. Genetic risk
    score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative effect
    of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA
    overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from the liver. We
    found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression
    through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin
    resistance through decreased expression of insulin receptor
    substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin
    sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA--blocking antibodies, PDGF
    receptor inhibitors, and by metformin, opening therapeutic avenues.
    Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased
    PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new
    therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.

- abstract: Hepatic DPP4 expression is elevated in subjects with ectopic
    fat accumulation in the liver. However, whether increased dipeptidyl
    peptidase 4 (DPP4) is involved in the pathogenesis or is rather a
    consequence of metabolic disease is not known. We therefore studied
    the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice prone
    to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of
    hepatic Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain,
    independent of liver fat content. In the same animals, methylation
    of four intronic CpG sites was decreased, amplifying glucose-induced
    transcription of hepatic Dpp4. In older mice, hepatic triglyceride
    content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression.
    Expression and release of DPP4 were markedly higher in the liver
    compared with adipose depots. Analysis of human liver biopsy
    specimens revealed a correlation of DPP4 expression and DNA
    methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic
    steatohepatitis. In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of
    the liver in participation to systemic DPP4 levels. Furthermore, the
    data show that glucose-induced expression of Dpp4 in the liver is
    facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life. This
    might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which
    in turn result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in
    life.

- abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public
    health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through
    trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of
    estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent
    replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166
    new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function
    on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function
    marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment
    analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the
    kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR
    was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent
    individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among
    783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46
    human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney
    compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in
    kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11
    genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide
    a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational
    research.
