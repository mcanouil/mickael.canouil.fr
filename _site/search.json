I was playing around with my data on ‘all’ the movies I have seen so far (mcanouil/imdb-ratings) and looking on possibly new ideas of visualisation on twitter using #ggplot2 and #gganimate (by the way the first time I played with gganimate was at useR-2018 (Brisbane, Australia), just before and when @thomasp85 released the actual framework). The only thing on the feed was “contaminated/deaths and covid-19” curves made with ggplot2 and a few with gganimate … Let’s say, it was not as funny and interesting as I was hoping for … Then, I’ve got an idea, what if I can do something funny and not expected with ggplot2 and gganimate? My first thought, was let’s draw and animate Pac-Man, that should not be that hard!\nWell, it was not that easy after-all … But, I am going to go through my code here (you might be interested to actually look at the commits history."

    "text": "3 The maze layer\n\n3.1 The base layer\nFirst thing first, I needed to set-up the base layer, meaning, the maze from Pac-Man. I did start by setting the coordinates of the maze.\n\nbase_layer <- ggplot() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", colour = \"black\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\", colour = \"black\"),\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed(xlim = c(0, 20), ylim = c(0, 26))\n\nFor later use, I defined some scales (actually those scales, where defined way after chronologically speaking). I am using those to define sizes and colours for all the geometries I am going to use to achieve the Pac-Man GIF.\n\nmap_colours <- c(\n  \"READY!\" = \"goldenrod1\",\n  \"wall\" = \"dodgerblue3\", \"door\" = \"dodgerblue3\",\n  \"normal\" = \"goldenrod1\", \"big\" = \"goldenrod1\", \"eaten\" = \"black\",\n  \"Pac-Man\" = \"yellow\",\n  \"eye\" = \"white\", \"iris\" = \"black\",\n  \"Blinky\" = \"red\", \"Blinky_weak\" = \"blue\", \"Blinky_eaten\" = \"transparent\",\n  \"Pinky\" = \"pink\", \"Pinky_weak\" = \"blue\", \"Pinky_eaten\" = \"transparent\",\n  \"Inky\" = \"cyan\", \"Inky_weak\" = \"blue\", \"Inky_eaten\" = \"transparent\",\n  \"Clyde\" = \"orange\", \"Clyde_weak\" = \"blue\", \"Clyde_eaten\" = \"transparent\"\n)\n\n\nbase_layer <- base_layer +\n  scale_size_manual(values = c(\"wall\" = 2.5, \"door\" = 1, \"big\" = 2.5, \"normal\" = 0.5, \"eaten\" = 3)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(breaks = names(map_colours), values = map_colours) +\n  scale_colour_manual(breaks = names(map_colours), values = map_colours)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy base_layer here is not really helpful, so I temporarily added some elements to help me draw everything on it. Note: I won’t use it in the following.\n\nbase_layer +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:21, sec.axis = dup_axis()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:26, sec.axis = dup_axis()) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = \"white\")\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 21, ymin = 0, ymax = 26, fill = NA)\n\n\n\n\nQuite better, isn’t it?!\n\n3.2 The grid layer\nHere, I am calling “grid”, the walls of the maze. For this grid, I started drawing the vertical lines on the left side of the maze (as you may have noticed, the first level is symmetrical).\n\nleft_vertical_segments <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~y, ~xend, ~yend,\n  0, 0, 0, 9,\n  0, 17, 0, 26,\n  2, 4, 2, 5,\n  2, 19, 2, 20,\n  2, 22, 2, 24,\n  4, 4, 4, 7,\n  4, 9, 4, 12,\n  4, 14, 4, 17,\n  4, 19, 4, 20,\n  4, 22, 4, 24,\n  6, 2, 6, 5,\n  6, 9, 6, 12,\n  6, 14, 6, 20,\n  6, 22, 6, 24,\n  8, 4, 8, 5,\n  8, 9, 8, 10,\n  8, 12, 8, 15,\n  8, 19, 8, 20,\n  8, 22, 8, 24\n)\n\n\nbase_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = left_vertical_segments,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    colour = \"white\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThen, I added the horizontal lines (still only on the left side of the maze)!\n\nleft_horizontal_segments <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~y, ~xend, ~yend,\n  0, 0, 10, 0,\n  2, 2, 8, 2,\n  0, 4, 2, 4,\n  8, 4, 10, 4,\n  0, 5, 2, 5,\n  8, 5, 10, 5,\n  2, 7, 4, 7,\n  6, 7, 8, 7,\n  0, 9, 4, 9,\n  8, 9, 10, 9,\n  8, 10, 10, 10,\n  0, 12, 4, 12,\n  8, 12, 10, 12,\n  0, 14, 4, 14,\n  8, 15, 9, 15,\n  0, 17, 4, 17,\n  6, 17, 8, 17,\n  2, 19, 4, 19,\n  8, 19, 10, 19,\n  2, 20, 4, 20,\n  8, 20, 10, 20,\n  2, 22, 4, 22,\n  6, 22, 8, 22,\n  2, 24, 4, 24,\n  6, 24, 8, 24,\n  0, 26, 10, 26\n)\n\nleft_segments <- bind_rows(left_vertical_segments, left_horizontal_segments)\n\n\nbase_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = left_segments,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    colour = \"white\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe maze is slowly appearing, but surely. As I wrote earlier, the first level is symmetrical, so I used my left lines left_segments to compute all the lines on the right right_segments.\n\nright_segments <-  mutate(\n  .data = left_segments,\n  x = abs(x - 20),\n  xend = abs(xend - 20)\n)\n\n\nbase_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = bind_rows(left_segments, right_segments),\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    colour = \"white\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe middle vertical lines were missing, i.e., I did not want to plot them twice, which would have happen, if I added these in left_segments. Also, the “door” of the ghost spawn area is missing. I added the door and the missing vertical walls in the end.\n\ncentre_vertical_segments <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~y, ~xend, ~yend,\n  10, 2, 10, 4,\n  10, 7, 10, 9,\n  10, 17, 10, 19,\n  10, 22, 10, 26\n)\ndoor_segment <- tibble(x = 9, y = 15, xend = 11, yend = 15, type = \"door\")\n\nFinally, I combined all the segments and drew them all.\n\nmaze_walls <- bind_rows(\n  left_segments,\n  centre_vertical_segments,\n  right_segments\n) %>%\n  mutate(type = \"wall\") %>%\n  bind_rows(door_segment)\n\n\nbase_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = maze_walls,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    colour = \"white\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe maze is now complete, but no-one can actually see the door, since it appears the same way as the walls. You may have noticed, I added a column named type. type can currently hold two values: \"wall\" and \"door\". I am going to use type as values for two aesthetics, you may already have guessed which ones. The answer is the colour and size aesthetics.\n\nbase_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = maze_walls,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, colour = type, size = type),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\nNote: maze_walls is a dataset of ggpacman (data(\"maze_walls\", package = \"ggpacman\")).\n\n3.3 The bonus points layer\nThe strategy was quite the same as for the grid layer:\n\nSetting up the point coordinates for the left side and the middle.\nCompute the coordinates for the right side.\nUse a column type for the two types of bonus points, i.e., \"normal\" and \"big\" (the one who weaken the ghosts).\n\n\nbonus_points_coord <- function() {\n  left_bonus_points <- tribble(\n    ~x, ~y, ~type,\n    1, c(1:3, 7:8, 18:22, 24:25), \"normal\",\n    1, c(6, 23), \"big\",\n    2, c(1, 3, 6, 8, 18, 21, 25), \"normal\",\n    3, c(1, 3:6, 8, 18, 21, 25), \"normal\",\n    4, c(1, 3, 8, 18, 21, 25), \"normal\",\n    5, c(1, 3:25), \"normal\",\n    6, c(1, 6, 8, 21, 25), \"normal\",\n    7, c(1, 3:6, 8, 18:21, 25), \"normal\",\n    8, c(1, 3, 6, 8, 18, 21, 25), \"normal\",\n    9, c(1:3, 6:8, 18, 21:25), \"normal\"\n  )\n\n  bind_rows(\n    left_bonus_points,\n    tribble(\n      ~x, ~y, ~type,\n      10, c(1, 21), \"normal\"\n    ),\n    mutate(left_bonus_points, x = abs(x - 20))\n  ) %>%\n    unnest(\"y\")\n}\nmaze_points <- bonus_points_coord()\n\n\nmaze_layer <- base_layer +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = maze_walls,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, colour = type, size = type),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    inherit.aes = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = maze_points,\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, size = type, colour = type),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: maze_points is a dataset of ggpacman (data(\"maze_points\", package = \"ggpacman\"))."

    "text": "5 Modify the Layout\nBecause everything that relates to the structure of the pages on the website are defined in HTML template files stored in a layouts directory, the answer to our “problem” should be there.\nAnd that is the case, as stated in a issue opened on GitHub (wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes #1520). More precisely in @CharlieLeee’s comment.\nAs mentioned in the comment, we need to modify a particular file, namely layouts/_default/single.html, but what is inside this layouts/_default/single.html file from the “wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic” theme?\nIn a default installation, the file is located in the following path themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/wowchemy/layouts/_default/single.html and it includes the following HTML/code.\n{{- define \"main\" -}}\n\n<article class=\"article\">\n\n  {{ partial \"page_header\" . }}\n\n  <div class=\"article-container\">\n\n    <div class=\"article-style\">\n      {{ .Content }}\n    </div>\n\n    {{ partial \"page_footer\" . }}\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n\n{{- end -}}\nNote: Have a look at HUGO website for the HUDO templating syntax.\nWe do not want to modify any of the files in the themes directory, so we will create a new file at the root directory of our blogdown website (layouts/_default/single.html).\nI am not going to use the code proposed in @CharlieLeee’s comment, but instead a slight modification to make the TOC a bit more responsive.\nIn this case, the TOC will use three out of the twelve columns in a wide screen (i.e., grid layout). On a smaller screen, the TOC will occupy twelve columns (i.e., equivalent to the css width: 100%;) and will be wrapped after the contents, hence it will be under.\nTo note and for later, in the code chunk below:\n\n\n.Content is a HUGO variable which contains the content of the post.\n\n.TableOfContents is a HUGO variable which contains the TOC of the post.\n\n{{- define \"main\" -}}\n\n<article class=\"article\">\n\n  {{ partial \"page_header\" . }}\n\n  <div class=\"article-container\">\n\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      \n      <div class=\"col-12 col-lg-9 article-style\">\n        {{ .Content }} <!-- HUGO variable which contains the content of the post -->\n      </div>\n      \n      <div class=\"col-12 col-lg-3 docs-toc\">\n        <ul class=\"nav toc-top\">\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#\" id=\"back_to_top\" class=\"docs-toc-title\">\n              {{ i18n \"on_this_page\" }}\n            </a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n    \n        {{ .TableOfContents }} <!-- HUGO variable which contains the TOC of the post -->\n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    {{ partial \"page_footer\" . }}\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n\n{{- end -}}\nAgain, we need to render the index.en.Rmd file, or to restart the website (blogdown::stop_server()/blogdown::serve_site()) to ensure all modifications are taken into account.\n\nNot quite, what we could have expected …\nThe TOC from the Rmarkdown (HTML) file is still at the top, but there is a “Contents” on the right side (as define in layouts/_default/single.html).\nThis “Contents” comes from our modified layout file and it is not included in a HUGO variable.\nThis TOC header is a hypertext reference to the top of the current page.\n<ul class=\"nav toc-top\">\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#\" id=\"back_to_top\" class=\"docs-toc-title\">\n      {{ i18n \"on_this_page\" }}\n    </a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nOur layout seems to “work”, but somehow, does not include the TOC of our HTML file generated from the index.en.Rmd file.\nLet’s have a look at another post in plain markdown from our blogdown website.\n\nBefore the modifications of the layout\nAfter the modifications of the layout\n\nIt’s looking great for the markdown post!\nIn conclusion and since we modified the page layout, the issue no longer seems to be on the HUGO side.\nIf we take a look at the HTML file produced by rmarkdown::render_site().\n---\ntitle: \"Hello R Markdown\"\nauthor: \"Frida Gomam\"\ndate: 2020-12-01T21:13:14-05:00\ncategories: [\"R\"]\ntags: [\"R Markdown\", \"plot\", \"regression\"]\noutput:\n  blogdown::html_page:\n    toc: true\n---\n\n<script src=\"{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js\"></script>\n\n<div id=\"TOC\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#r-markdown\">R Markdown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#including-plots\">Including Plots</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"r-markdown\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>R Markdown</h2>\n<p>This is an R Markdown document.

It is the HUGO variable seen earlier, which contains the TOC.\nTo know this, well you have to read HUGO’s documentation.\nAt this point, you might not see where all this is going.\nLet me clarify all the information we have:\n\nHUGO translate markdown files to HTML files.\nHUGO has a variable/id for the TOC, named TableOfContents\n\nWe can change the layout of the HUGO theme to include TOC (if the theme does not already include it as for “wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic”).\n\nIt works on plain markdown posts.\nIt does not on HTML posts produced from .Rmd files.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, there is something wrong with the HTML files produced from .Rmd files."
