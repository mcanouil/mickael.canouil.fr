	abstract = {Excessive fetal growth is associated with DNA methylation alterations in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), but their functional impact remains elusive. We implemented an integrative analysis combining single-cell epigenomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro analyses to functionally link DNA methylation changes to putative alterations of HSPC functions. We showed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from large for gestational age neonates that both DNA hypermethylation and chromatin rearrangements target a specific network of transcription factors known to sustain stem cell quiescence. In parallel, we found a decreased expression of key genes regulating HSC differentiation including EGR1, KLF2, SOCS3, and JUNB. Our functional analyses showed that this epigenetic programming was associated with a decreased ability for HSCs to remain quiescent. Taken together, our multimodal approach using single-cell (epi)genomics showed that human fetal overgrowth affects hematopoietic stem cells’ quiescence signaling via epigenetic programming.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse perinatal outcomes. GDM often reoccurs and is associated with increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To improve our understanding of the aetiological factors and molecular processes driving the occurrence of GDM, including the extent to which these overlap with T2D pathophysiology, the GENetics of Diabetes In Pregnancy Consortium assembled genome-wide association studies of diverse ancestry in a total of 5485 women with GDM and 347 856 without GDM. Through multi-ancestry meta-analysis, we identified five loci with genome-wide significant association (P \&lt; 5 × 10−8) with GDM, mapping to/near MTNR1B (P = 4.3 × 10−54), TCF7L2 (P = 4.0 × 10−16), CDKAL1 (P = 1.6 × 10−14), CDKN2A-CDKN2B (P = 4.1 × 10−9) and HKDC1 (P = 2.9 × 10−8). Multiple lines of evidence pointed to the shared pathophysiology of GDM and T2D: (i) four of the five GDM loci (not HKDC1) have been previously reported at genome-wide significance for T2D; (ii) significant enrichment for associations with GDM at previously reported T2D loci; (iii) strong genetic correlation between GDM and T2D and (iv) enrichment of GDM associations mapping to genomic annotations in diabetes-relevant tissues and transcription factor binding sites. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrated significant causal association (5\% false discovery rate) of higher body mass index on increased GDM risk. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that GDM and T2D are part of the same underlying pathology but that, as exemplified by the HKDC1 locus, there are genetic determinants of GDM that are specific to glucose regulation in pregnancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
              Maternal glycemic dysregulation during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in her offspring, a risk thought to be linearly related to maternal hyperglycemia. It is hypothesized that changes in offspring DNA methylation (DNAm) underline these associations.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              To address this hypothesis, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from eight birth cohorts investigating relationships between cord blood DNAm and fetal exposure to maternal glucose (Nmaximum = 3,503), insulin (Nmaximum = 2,062), and area under the curve of glucose (AUCgluc) following oral glucose tolerance tests (Nmaximum = 1,505). We performed lookup analyses for identified cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in independent observational cohorts to examine associations between DNAm and cardiometabolic traits as well as tissue-specific gene expression.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Greater maternal AUCgluc was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at neighboring CpGs cg26974062 (β [SE] −0.013 [2.1 × 10−3], P value corrected for false discovery rate [PFDR] = 5.1 × 10−3) and cg02988288 (β [SE]−0.013 [2.3 × 10−3], PFDR = 0.031) in TXNIP. These associations were attenuated in women with GDM. Lower blood DNAm at these two CpGs near TXNIP was associated with multiple metabolic traits later in life, including type 2 diabetes. TXNIP DNAm in liver biopsies was associated with hepatic expression of TXNIP. We observed little evidence of associations between either maternal glucose or insulin and cord blood DNAm.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Maternal hyperglycemia, as reflected by AUCgluc, was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at TXNIP. Associations between DNAm at these CpGs and metabolic traits in subsequent lookup analyses suggest that these may be candidate loci to investigate in future causal and mediation analyses.},

In a previous study, next-generation sequencing revealed a monogenic etiology in ∼50\% of the children with severe obesity from a consanguineous population in Pakistan. Here we assess rare variants in obesity-causing genes in young adults with severe obesity from the same region. Genomic DNA from 126 randomly selected young adult obese subjects (BMI 37.2 ± 0.3 kg/m2; age 18.4 ± 0.3 years) was screened by conventional or augmented whole-exome analysis for point mutations and copy number variants (CNVs). Leptin, insulin, and cortisol levels were measured by ELISA. We identified 13 subjects carrying 13 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in LEPR, PCSK1, MC4R, NTRK2, POMC, SH2B1, and SIM1. We also identified for the first time in the human, two homozygous stop-gain mutations in ASNSD1 and IFI16 genes. Inactivation of these genes in mouse models has been shown to result in obesity. Additionally, we describe nine homozygous mutations (seven missense, one stop-gain, and one stop-loss) and four copy-loss CNVs in genes or genomic regions previously linked to obesity-associated traits by genome-wide association studies. Unexpectedly, in contrast to obese children, pathogenic mutations in LEP and LEPR were either absent or rare in this cohort of young adults. High morbidity and mortality risks and social disadvantage of children with LEP or LEPR deficiency may in part explain this difference between the two cohorts.},

              The hepatokine follistatin is elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and promotes hyperglycemia in mice. Here we explore the relationship of plasma follistatin levels with incident T2D and mechanisms involved. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in follistatin levels for T2D is 1.24 (CI: 1.04–1.47,
              p
               {\textless} 0.05) during 19-year follow-up (
              n
               = 4060, Sweden); and 1.31 (CI: 1.09–1.58,
              p
               {\textless} 0.01) during 4-year follow-up (
              n
               = 883, Finland). High circulating follistatin associates with adipose tissue insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (
              n
               = 210, Germany). In human adipocytes, follistatin dose-dependently increases free fatty acid release. In genome-wide association study (GWAS), variation in the glucokinase regulatory protein gene (
              GCKR
              ) associates with plasma follistatin levels (

              n
               = 885, UK, Italy and Sweden) and GCKR regulates follistatin secretion in hepatocytes in vitro. Our findings suggest that GCKR regulates follistatin secretion and that elevated circulating follistatin associates with an increased risk of T2D by inducing adipose tissue insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
              Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of obesity and insulin resistance in offspring later in life, which might be explained by epigenetic changes in response to maternal hyperglycemic exposure.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              We explored the association between GDM exposure and maternal blood and newborn cord blood methylation in 536 mother-offspring pairs from the prospective FinnGeDi cohort using Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip arrays. We assessed two hypotheses. First, we tested for shared maternal and offspring epigenetic effects resulting from GDM exposure. Second, we tested whether GDM exposure and maternal methylation had an epigenetic effect on the offspring.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We did not find any epigenetic marks (differentially methylated CpG probes) with shared and consistent effects between mothers and offspring. After including maternal methylation in the model, we identified a single significant (false discovery rate 1.38 × 10−2) CpG at the cg22790973 probe (TFCP2) associated with GDM. We identified seven additional FDR-significant interactions of maternal methylation and GDM status, with the strongest association at the same cg22790973 probe (TFCP2), as well as cg03456133, cg24440941 (H3C6), cg20002843 (LOC127841), cg19107264, and cg11493553 located within the UBE3C gene and cg17065901 in FAM13A, both susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes and BMI, and cg23355087 within the DLGAP2 gene, known to be involved in insulin resistance during pregnancy.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Our study reveals the potential complexity of the epigenetic transmission between mothers with GDM and their offspring, likely determined by not only GDM exposure but also other factors indicated by maternal epigenetic status, such as maternal metabolic history.},

            Inflaming insulin resistance
            
              Patients with the developmental disorder Noonan syndrome (NS) may be prone to insulin resistance. Studying the hyperactivation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 associated with this disease, Paccoud
              et al
              . now pinpoint an inflammatory origin of insulin resistance. Hyperactivation of SHP2 associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in patients with NS. In a hyperactive SHP2 mouse model, bone marrow–derived and liver-resident macrophages shifted toward a proinflammatory profile, leading to altered systemic glucose homeostasis. Small-molecule targeting of SHP2 in wild-type diet-induced obese mice reduced inflammation in metabolic tissues and improved insulin sensitivity, hinting at the potential of targeting SHP2 for metabolic syndrome.
            
          , 
            Insulin resistance is a key event in type 2 diabetes onset and a major comorbidity of obesity. It results from a combination of fat excess–triggered defects, including lipotoxicity and metaflammation, but the causal mechanisms remain difficult to identify. Here, we report that hyperactivation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 found in Noonan syndrome (NS) led to an unsuspected insulin resistance profile uncoupled from altered lipid management (for example, obesity or ectopic lipid deposits) in both patients and mice. Functional exploration of an NS mouse model revealed this insulin resistance phenotype correlated with constitutive inflammation of tissues involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Bone marrow transplantation and macrophage depletion improved glucose homeostasis and decreased metaflammation in the mice, highlighting a key role of macrophages. In-depth analysis of bone marrow–derived macrophages in vitro and liver macrophages showed that hyperactive SHP2 promoted a proinflammatory phenotype, modified resident macrophage homeostasis, and triggered monocyte infiltration. Consistent with a role of SHP2 in promoting inflammation-driven insulin resistance, pharmaceutical SHP2 inhibition in obese diabetic mice improved insulin sensitivity even better than conventional antidiabetic molecules by specifically reducing metaflammation and alleviating macrophage activation. Together, these results reveal that SHP2 hyperactivation leads to inflammation-triggered metabolic impairments and highlight the therapeutical potential of SHP2 inhibition to ameliorate insulin resistance.},

              Background
              Adipogenesis, the process whereby preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes, is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Cholesterol-lowering statins increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk possibly by affecting adipogenesis and insulin resistance but the (epi)genetic mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we characterised the effects of statin treatment on adipocyte differentiation using in vitro human preadipocyte cell model to identify putative effective genes.
            
            
              Results
              
                Statin treatment during adipocyte differentiation caused a reduction in key genes involved in adipogenesis, such as
                ADIPOQ
                ,
                GLUT4
                and
                ABCG1.
                Using Illumina’s Infinium ‘850K’ Methylation EPIC array, we found a significant hypomethylation of cg14566882, located in the promoter of the histone deacetylase 9 (
                HDAC9)
                gene, in response to two types of statins (atorvastatin and mevastatin), which correlates with an increased
                HDAC9
                mRNA expression. We confirmed that HDAC9 is a transcriptional repressor of the cholesterol efflux
                ABCG1
                gene expression, which is epigenetically modified in obesity and prediabetic states. Thus, we assessed the putative impact of
                ABCG1
                knockdown in mimicking the effect of statin in adipogenesis.
                ABCG1
                KD reduced the expression of key genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin signalling and glucose uptake. In human blood cells from two cohorts,
                ABCG1
                expression was impaired in response to statins, confirming that
                ABCG1
                is targeted in vivo by these drugs.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We identified an epigenetic link between adipogenesis and adipose tissue insulin resistance in the context of T2D risk associated with statin use, which has important implications as HDAC9 and ABCG1 are considered potential therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.},

              Summary
              The NanoStringTM nCounter® is a platform for the targeted quantification of expression data in biofluids and tissues. While software by the manufacturer is available in addition to third parties packages, they do not provide a complete quality control (QC) pipeline. Here, we present NACHO (‘NAnostring quality Control dasHbOard’), a comprehensive QC R-package. The package consists of three subsequent steps: summarize, visualize and normalize. The summarize function collects all the relevant data and stores it in a tidy format, the visualize function initiates a dashboard with plots of the relevant QC outcomes. It contains QC metrics that are measured by default by the manufacturer, but also calculates other insightful measures, including the scaling factors that are needed in the normalization step. In this normalization step, different normalization methods can be chosen to optimally preprocess data.

            Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies-implicated loci have been reported for adult obesity-related traits, less is known about the genetics specific for early-onset obesity and with only a few studies conducted in non-European populations to date. Searching for additional genetic variants associated with childhood obesity, we performed a trans-ancestral meta-analysis of 30 studies consisting of up to 13 005 cases (≥95th percentile of body mass index (BMI) achieved 2–18 years old) and 15 599 controls (consistently \&lt;50th percentile of BMI) of European, African, North/South American and East Asian ancestry. Suggestive loci were taken forward for replication in a sample of 1888 cases and 4689 controls from seven cohorts of European and North/South American ancestry. In addition to observing 18 previously implicated BMI or obesity loci, for both early and late onset, we uncovered one completely novel locus in this trans-ancestral analysis (nearest gene, METTL15). The variant was nominally associated with only the European subgroup analysis but had a consistent direction of effect in other ethnicities. We then utilized trans-ancestral Bayesian analysis to narrow down the location of the probable causal variant at each genome-wide significant signal. Of all the fine-mapped loci, we were able to narrow down the causative variant at four known loci to fewer than 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FAIM2, GNPDA2, MC4R and SEC16B loci). In conclusion, an ethnically diverse setting has enabled us to both identify an additional pediatric obesity locus and further fine-map existing loci.},

              Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the health of millions of people worldwide. The identification of genetic determinants associated with changes in glycemia over time might illuminate biological features that precede the development of T2D. Here we conducted a genome-wide association study of longitudinal fasting glucose changes in up to 13,807 non-diabetic individuals of European descent from nine cohorts. Fasting glucose change over time was defined as the slope of the line defined by multiple fasting glucose measurements obtained over up to 14 years of observation. We tested for associations of genetic variants with inverse-normal transformed fasting glucose change over time adjusting for age at baseline, sex, and principal components of genetic variation. We found no genome-wide significant association (P {\textless} 5 × 10
              −8
              ) with fasting glucose change over time. Seven loci previously associated with T2D, fasting glucose or HbA1c were nominally (P {\textless} 0.05) associated with fasting glucose change over time. Limited power influences unambiguous interpretation, but these data suggest that genetic effects on fasting glucose change over time are likely to be small. A public version of the data provides a genomic resource to combine with future studies to evaluate shared genetic links with T2D and other metabolic risk traits.},

            Elevated blood pressure (BP), a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, is influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors. Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor. Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene–smoking interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in 129 913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in 480 178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci significantly associated with MAP and/or PP. Of these, 61 were previously published through main-effect analysis of BP traits, 37 were recently reported by us for systolic BP and/or diastolic BP through gene–smoking interaction analysis and 38 were newly identified (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8, false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05). We also identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8 showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation. SLC26A7 encodes a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger expressed in the renal outer medullary collecting duct. AVPR1A is widely expressed, including in vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, myocardium and brain. FHAD1 is a long non-coding RNA overexpressed in heart failure. TMEM51 was associated with contractile function in cardiomyocytes. CASP9 plays a central role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Identified only in African ancestry were 30 novel loci. Our findings highlight the value of multi-ancestry investigations, particularly in studies of interaction with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences may contribute to novel findings.},

              Many genetic loci affect circulating lipid levels, but it remains unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, modify these genetic effects. To identify lipid loci interacting with physical activity, we performed genome-wide analyses of circulating HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in up to 120,979 individuals of European, African, Asian, Hispanic, and Brazilian ancestry, with follow-up of suggestive associations in an additional 131,012 individuals. We find four loci, in/near
              CLASP1
              ,
              LHX1
              ,

              , and
              CNTNAP2
              , that are associated with circulating lipid levels through interaction with physical activity; higher levels of physical activity enhance the HDL cholesterol-increasing effects of the
              CLASP1

              LHX1

            Melatonin meets diabetes
            
              Some of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) occur in the gene encoding the melatonin receptor MT
              2
              , a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). Karamitri
              et al
              . measured the spontaneous and melatonin-stimulated signaling of 40 different MT
              2
              variants. Computational analysis of these signaling profiles and assessment of genetic association data showed that those MT
              2
              variants with defective melatonin-stimulated G protein signaling and reduced spontaneous β-arrestin recruitment were associated with the greatest risk for T2D. These data may aid in the development of specific treatments for T2D depending on the patient’s MT
              2
              variant. Moreover, the experimental approach may be applied to assess the impact of other GPCR mutations on disease associations.
            
          , 
            
              Melatonin is produced during the night and regulates sleep and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in
              MTNR1B
              , which encodes the melatonin receptor MT
              2
              , a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 MT
              2
              variants by monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and melatonin-induced activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association analysis showed that defects in the melatonin-induced activation of Gα
              i1
              and Gα
              z
              proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment to MT
              2
              were the most statistically significantly associated with an increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive tool for future studies on GPCR variants. Together, this large-scale functional study provides an operational framework for the postgenomic analysis of the multiple GPCR variants present in the human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling pathway–specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential relevance of MT

              function during the day, when melatonin is undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.},

	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we hypothesized that the DNA methylome of livers from patients with T2D compared with livers of individuals with normal plasma glucose levels can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found that hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA (encoding platelet-derived growth factor α) and PDGFA overexpression are both associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance, and increased steatohepatitis risk. Genetic risk score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative effect of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from the liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA–blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors, and by metformin, opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.},

	abstract = {Hepatic DPP4 expression is elevated in subjects with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. However, whether increased dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is involved in the pathogenesis or is rather a consequence of metabolic disease is not known. We therefore studied the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice prone to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of hepatic Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain, independent of liver fat content. In the same animals, methylation of four intronic CpG sites was decreased, amplifying glucose-induced transcription of hepatic Dpp4. In older mice, hepatic triglyceride content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression. Expression and release of DPP4 were markedly higher in the liver compared with adipose depots. Analysis of human liver biopsy specimens revealed a correlation of DPP4 expression and DNA methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of the liver in participation to systemic DPP4 levels. Furthermore, the data show that glucose-induced expression of Dpp4 in the liver is facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life. This might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which in turn result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in life.},

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational research.},

            We identify biomarkers for disease progression in three type 2 diabetes cohorts encompassing 2,973 individuals across three molecular classes, metabolites, lipids and proteins. Homocitrulline, isoleucine and 2-aminoadipic acid, eight triacylglycerol species, and lowered sphingomyelin 42:2;2 levels are predictive of faster progression towards insulin requirement. Of {\textasciitilde}1,300 proteins examined in two cohorts, levels of GDF15/MIC-1, IL-18Ra, CRELD1, NogoR, FAS, and ENPP7 are associated with faster progression, whilst SMAC/DIABLO, SPOCK1 and HEMK2 predict lower progression rates. In an external replication, proteins and lipids are associated with diabetes incidence and prevalence. NogoR/RTN4R injection improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed male mice but impaired it in male db/db mice. High NogoR levels led to islet cell apoptosis, and IL-18R antagonised inflammatory IL-18 signalling towards nuclear factor kappa-B in vitro. This comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach thus identifies biomarkers with potential prognostic utility, provides evidence for possible disease mechanisms, and identifies potential therapeutic avenues to slow diabetes progression.},

              Importance and Objective
              The identification of myokines susceptible to improve glucose homeostasis following bariatric surgery could lead to new therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Methods
              Changes in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) test were assessed in patients before and 3 months after bariatric surgery. Changes in myokines expression and circulating levels were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Myokines known to regulate glucose homeostasis were identified using literature (targeted study) and putative myokines using RNA-sequencing (untargeted study). A linear regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was used to search for associations between changes in the HOMA test and changes in myokines.
            
            
              Results
              In the targeted study, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was upregulated (+30\%, P = .006) while BDNF circulating levels were decreased (−12\%, P = .001). Upregulated BDNF expression was associated with decreased HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (adjusted estimate [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}]: −0.51 [−0.88 to −0.13], P = .010). Decreased BDNF serum levels were associated with decreased HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) (adjusted estimate [95\% CI] = 0.002 [0.00002-0.0031], P = .046). In the untargeted study, upregulated putative myokines included XYLT1 (+64\%, P \&lt; .001), LGR5 (+57, P\&lt; .001), and SPINK5 (+46\%, P \&lt; .001). Upregulated LGR5 was associated with decreased HOMA-IR (adjusted estimate [95\% CI] = −0.50 [−0.86 to −0.13], P = .009). Upregulated XYLT1 and SPINK5 were associated with increased HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) (respectively, adjusted estimate [95\% CI] = 109.1 [28.5-189.8], P = .009 and 16.5 [0.87-32.19], P = .039).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Improved glucose homeostasis following bariatric surgery is associated with changes in myokines expression and circulating levels. In particular, upregulation of BDNF, XYLT1, SPINK5, and LGR5 is associated with improved insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that these myokines could contribute to improved glucose homeostasis following bariatric surgery.

              Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes
              1,2
              and molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type
              3,4
              . Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7\% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (

              −8
              ) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores

              in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.},

PNLIPRP1 null variants (in 191K participants of the UKbiobank) associated with elevated glycemia and LDL-cholesterol. Mendelian Randomisation using 2.5M SNP OmniArrays in 111 donors evidenced that T2D was causal of PNLIPRP1 hypermethylation, which was causal for LDL-cholesterol. Further AR42J rat exocrine cell studies demonstrated that Pnliprp1 knockdown induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a known pre-pancreatic cancer state, and increased cholesterol levels, reversible with statin. This (epi)genetic study suggests a role for PNLIPRP1 in human metabolism and on exocrine pancreas function with potential implications for pancreatic diseases.},

              Genetic effects on changes in human traits over time are understudied and may have important pathophysiological impact. We propose a framework that enables data quality control, implements mixed models to evaluate trajectories of change in traits, and estimates phenotypes to identify age-varying genetic effects in GWAS. Using childhood BMI as an example trait, we included 71,336 participants from six cohorts and estimated the slope and area under the BMI curve within four time periods (infancy, early childhood, late childhood and adolescence) for each participant, in addition to the age and BMI at the adiposity peak and the adiposity rebound. GWAS of the 12 estimated phenotypes identified 28 genome-wide significant variants at 13 loci, one of which (in
              DAOA)
              has not been previously associated with childhood or adult BMI. Genetic studies of changes in human traits over time could uncover unique biological mechanisms influencing quantitative traits.},
