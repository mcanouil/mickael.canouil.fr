	abstract = {Most genome-wide association studies used genetic-model-based tests assuming an additive mode of inheritance, leading to underpowered association tests in case of departure from additivity. The general regression model (GRM) association test proposed by Fisher and Wilson in 1980 makes no assumption on the genetic model. Interestingly, it also allows formal testing of the underlying genetic model. We conducted a simulation study of quantitative traits to compare the power of the GRM test to the classical linear regression tests, the maximum of the three statistics (MAX), and the allele-based (allelic) tests. Simulations were performed on two samples sizes, using a large panel of genetic models, varying genetic models, minor allele frequencies, and the percentage of explained variance. In case of departure from additivity, the GRM was more powerful than the additive regression tests (power gain reaching 80\%) and had similar power when the true model is additive. GRM was also as or more powerful than the MAX or allelic tests. The true simulated model was mostly retained by the GRM test. Application of GRM to HbA1c illustrates its gain in power. To conclude, GRM increases power to detect association for quantitative traits, allows determining the genetic model and is easily applicable.},

Here, we present NACHO (‘NAnostring quality Control dasHbOard’), a comprehensive QC R-package. The package consists of three subsequent steps: summarize, visualize and normalize. The summarize function collects all the relevant data and stores it in a tidy format, the visualize function initiates a dashboard with plots of the relevant QC outcomes. It contains QC metrics that are measured by default by the manufacturer, but also calculates other insightful measures, including the scaling factors that are needed in the normalization step. In this normalization step, different normalization methods can be chosen to optimally preprocess data. Together, NACHO is a comprehensive method that optimizes insight and preprocessing of nCounter® data.NACHO is available as an R-package on CRAN and the development version on GitHub https://github.com/mcanouil/NACHO.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 250 loci associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity. However, post-GWAS functional genomic investigations have been inadequate for understanding how these genetic loci physiologically impact disease development. We performed a PCR-free expression assay targeting genes located nearby the GWAS-identified SNPs associated with BMI/obesity in a large panel of human tissues. Furthermore, we analyzed several genetic risk scores (GRS) summing GWAS-identified alleles associated with increased BMI in 4236 individuals. We found that the expression of BMI/obesity susceptibility genes was strongly enriched in the brain, especially in the insula (p = 4.7 × 10–9) and substantia nigra (p = 6.8 × 10–7), which are two brain regions involved in addiction and reward. Inversely, we found that top obesity/BMI-associated loci, including FTO, showed the strongest gene expression enrichment in the two brain regions. Our data suggest for the first time that the susceptibility genes for common obesity may have an effect on eating addiction and reward behaviors through their high expression in substantia nigra and insula, i.e., a different pattern from monogenic obesity genes that act in the hypothalamus and cause hyperphagia. Further epidemiological studies with relevant food behavior phenotypes are necessary to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the health of millions of people worldwide. The identification of genetic determinants associated with changes in glycemia over time might illuminate biological features that precede the development of T2D. Here we conducted a genome-wide association study of longitudinal fasting glucose changes in up to 13,807 non-diabetic individuals of European descent from nine cohorts. Fasting glucose change over time was defined as the slope of the line defined by multiple fasting glucose measurements obtained over up to 14 years of observation. We tested for associations of genetic variants with inverse-normal transformed fasting glucose change over time adjusting for age at baseline, sex, and principal components of genetic variation. We found no genome-wide significant association (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) with fasting glucose change over time. Seven loci previously associated with T2D, fasting glucose or HbA1c were nominally (P {\textless} 0.05) associated with fasting glucose change over time. Limited power influences unambiguous interpretation, but these data suggest that genetic effects on fasting glucose change over time are likely to be small. A public version of the data provides a genomic resource to combine with future studies to evaluate shared genetic links with T2D and other metabolic risk traits.},

	abstract = {Melatonin meets diabetes
Some of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) occur in the gene encoding the melatonin receptor MT2, a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). Karamitri et al. measured the spontaneous and melatonin-stimulated signaling of 40 different MT2 variants. Computational analysis of these signaling profiles and assessment of genetic association data showed that those MT2 variants with defective melatonin-stimulated G protein signaling and reduced spontaneous β-arrestin recruitment were associated with the greatest risk for T2D. These data may aid in the development of specific treatments for T2D depending on the patient’s MT2 variant. Moreover, the experimental approach may be applied to assess the impact of other GPCR mutations on disease associations.
Melatonin is produced during the night and regulates sleep and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in MTNR1B, which encodes the melatonin receptor MT2, a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 MT2 variants by monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and melatonin-induced activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association analysis showed that defects in the melatonin-induced activation of Gαi1 and Gαz proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment to MT2 were the most statistically significantly associated with an increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive tool for future studies on GPCR variants. Together, this large-scale functional study provides an operational framework for the postgenomic analysis of the multiple GPCR variants present in the human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling pathway–specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential relevance of MT2 function during the day, when melatonin is undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.
Connecting melatonin receptor variants to signaling differences reveals paths to type 2 diabetes therapy.

	abstract = {Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for hypertension; the mechanism by which alcohol consumption impact blood pressure (BP) regulation remains unknown. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study accounting for gene-alcohol consumption interaction for BP might identify additional BP loci and contribute to the understanding of alcohol-related BP regulation. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-alcohol consumption interactions. In Stage 1, genome-wide discovery meta-analyses in ≈131K individuals across several ancestry groups yielded 3,514 SNVs (245 loci) with suggestive evidence of association (P {\textless} 1.0 x 10−5). In Stage 2, these SNVs were tested for independent external replication in ≈440K individuals across multiple ancestries. We identified and replicated (at Bonferroni correction threshold) five novel BP loci (380 SNVs in 21 genes) and 49 previously reported BP loci (2,159 SNVs in 109 genes) in European ancestry, and in multi-ancestry meta-analyses (P {\textless} 5.0 x 10−8). For African ancestry samples, we detected 18 potentially novel BP loci (P {\textless} 5.0 x 10−8) in Stage 1 that warrant further replication. Additionally, correlated meta-analysis identified eight novel BP loci (11 genes). Several genes in these loci (e.g., PINX1, GATA4, BLK, FTO and GABBR2) have been previously reported to be associated with alcohol consumption. These findings provide insights into the role of alcohol consumption in the genetic architecture of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been suspected to be associated with deleterious effects on health including obesity and metabolically-linked diseases. Although bisphenols F (BPF) and S (BPS) are BPA structural analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for BPA, only sparse toxicological data are available yet. Our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a "low-dose" similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose. Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10 μM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. We detected significantly deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses. Enrichment in "cancer" and "organismal injury and abnormalities" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors. All these results suggest that as BPA, its substitutes BPS and BPF should be used with the same restrictions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Salivary (AMY1) and pancreatic (AMY2) amylases hydrolyze starch. Copy number of AMY1A (encoding AMY1) was reported to be higher in populations with a high-starch diet and reduced in obese people. These results based on quantitative PCR have been challenged recently. We aimed to re-assess the relationship between amylase and adiposity using a systems biology approach.
METHODS: We assessed the association between plasma enzymatic activity of AMY1 or AMY2, and several metabolic traits in almost 4000 French individuals from D.E.S.I.R. longitudinal study. The effect of the number of copies of AMY1A (encoding AMY1) or AMY2A (encoding AMY2) measured through droplet digital PCR was then analyzed on the same parameters in the same study. A Mendelian randomization analysis was also performed. We subsequently assessed the association between AMY1A copy number and obesity risk in two case-control studies (5000 samples in total). Finally, we assessed the association between body mass index (BMI)-related plasma metabolites and AMY1 or AMY2 activity.
RESULTS: We evidenced strong associations between AMY1 or AMY2 activity and lower BMI. However, we found a modest contribution of AMY1A copy number to lower BMI. Mendelian randomization identified a causal negative effect of BMI on AMY1 and AMY2 activities. Yet, we also found a significant negative contribution of AMY1 activity at baseline to the change in BMI during the 9-year follow-up, and a significant contribution of AMY1A copy number to lower obesity risk in children, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between AMY1 activity and adiposity. Metabonomics identified a BMI-independent association between AMY1 activity and lactate, a product of complex carbohydrate fermentation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the involvement of amylase in adiposity and starch metabolism.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association analysis advanced understanding of blood pressure (BP), a major risk factor for vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify BP loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic BP incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined ∼18.8 million SNPs and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p {\textless} 5 × 10-8) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known BP loci were also identified by our results (p {\textless} 5 × 10-8). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in BP regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function (CDKN1B, BCAR1-CFDP1, PXDN, EEA1), ciliopathies (SDCCAG8, RPGRIP1L), telomere maintenance (TNKS, PINX1, AKTIP), and central dopaminergic signaling (MSRA, EBF2).},

	abstract = {Genetic variants near ARAP1 (CENTD2) and STARD10 influence type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The risk alleles impair glucose-induced insulin secretion and, paradoxically but characteristically, are associated with decreased proinsulin:insulin ratios, indicating improved proinsulin conversion. Neither the identity of the causal variants nor the gene(s) through which risk is conferred have been firmly established. Whereas ARAP1 encodes a GTPase activating protein, STARD10 is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer protein family. By integrating genetic fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation data and performing promoter-reporter and chromatin conformational capture (3C) studies in β cell lines, we localize the causal variant(s) at this locus to a 5 kb region that overlaps a stretch-enhancer active in islets. This region contains several highly correlated T2D-risk variants, including the rs140130268 indel. Expression QTL analysis of islet transcriptomes from three independent subject groups demonstrated that T2D-risk allele carriers displayed reduced levels of STARD10 mRNA, with no concomitant change in ARAP1 mRNA levels. Correspondingly, β-cell-selective deletion of StarD10 in mice led to impaired glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and insulin secretion and recapitulated the pattern of improved proinsulin processing observed at the human GWAS signal. Conversely, overexpression of StarD10 in the adult β cell improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed animals. In contrast, manipulation of Arap1 in β cells had no impact on insulin secretion or proinsulin conversion in mice. This convergence of human and murine data provides compelling evidence that the T2D risk associated with variation at this locus is mediated through reduction in STARD10 expression in the β cell.},

	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we hypothesized that DNA methylome of livers from patients with T2D, when compared to livers of individuals with normal plasma glucose levels, can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA (encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression are associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression of both insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors and by metformin opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.},

	abstract = {In observational cohorts, longitudinal data are collected with repeated measurements at predetermined time points for many biomarkers, along with other variables measured at baseline. In these cohorts, time until a certain event of interest occurs is reported and very often, a relationship will be observed between some biomarker repeatedly measured over time and that event. Joint models were designed to efficiently estimate statistical parameters describing this relationship by combining a mixed model for the longitudinal biomarker trajectory and a survival model for the time until occurrence of the event, using a set of random effects to account for the relationship between the two types of data. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of joint models in genetic association studies. First, we check model consistency based on different simulation scenarios, by varying sample sizes, minor allele frequencies and number of repeated measurements. Second, using genotypes assayed with the Metabochip DNA arrays (Illumina) from about 4,500 individuals recruited in the French cohort D.E.S.I.R. ({\textbackslash}textit\{Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome\}), we assess the feasibility of implementing the joint modelling approach in a real high-throughput genomic dataset. An alternative model approximating the joint model, called the Two-Step approach (TS), is also presented. Although the joint model shows more precise and less biased estimators than its alternative counterpart, the TS approach results in much reduced computational times, and could thus be used for testing millions of SNPs at the genome-wide scale.},

We make two important observations. First, only five of these signals are driven by low-frequency variants: even for these, effect sizes are modest (odds ratio ≤1.29). Second, when we used large-scale genome-wide association data to fine-map the associated variants in their regional context, accounting for the global enrichment of complex trait associations in coding sequence, compelling evidence for coding variant causality was obtained for only 16 signals. At 13 others, the associated coding variants clearly represent 'false leads' with potential to generate erroneous mechanistic inference. Coding variant associations offer a direct route to biological insight for complex diseases and identification of validated therapeutic targets; however, appropriate mechanistic inference requires careful specification of their causal contribution to disease predisposition.},

	abstract = {Hepatic DPP4 expression is elevated in subjects with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. However, whether increased dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is involved in the pathogenesis or is rather a consequence of metabolic disease is not known. We therefore studied the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice prone to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of hepatic Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain, independent of liver fat content. In the same animals, methylation of four intronic CpG sites was decreased, amplifying glucose-induced transcription of hepatic Dpp4 In older mice, hepatic triglyceride content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression. Expression and release of DPP4 were markedly higher in the liver compared with adipose depots. Analysis of human liver biopsy specimens revealed a correlation of DPP4 expression and DNA methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of the liver in participation to systemic DPP4 levels. Furthermore, the data show that glucose-induced expression of Dpp4 in the liver is facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life. This might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which in turn result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in life.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified {\textgreater}100 loci independently contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. However, translational implications for precision medicine and for the development of novel treatments have been disappointing, due to poor knowledge of how these loci impact T2D pathophysiology. Here, we aimed to measure the expression of genes located nearby T2D associated signals and to assess their effect on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.
METHODS: The expression of 104 candidate T2D susceptibility genes was measured in a human multi-tissue panel, through PCR-free expression assay. The effects of the knockdown of beta-cell enriched genes were next investigated on insulin secretion from the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line. Finally, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) so as to assess the pathways affected by the knockdown of the new genes impacting insulin secretion from EndoC-βH1, and we analyzed the expression of the new genes in mouse models with altered pancreatic beta-cell function.
RESULTS: We found that the candidate T2D susceptibility genes' expression is significantly enriched in pancreatic beta cells obtained by laser capture microdissection or sorted by flow cytometry and in EndoC-βH1 cells, but not in insulin sensitive tissues. Furthermore, the knockdown of seven T2D-susceptibility genes (CDKN2A, GCK, HNF4A, KCNK16, SLC30A8, TBC1D4, and TCF19) with already known expression and/or function in beta cells changed insulin secretion, supporting our functional approach. We showed first evidence for a role in insulin secretion of four candidate T2D-susceptibility genes (PRC1, SRR, ZFAND3, and ZFAND6) with no previous knowledge of presence and function in beta cells. RNA-seq in EndoC-βH1 cells with decreased expression of PRC1, SRR, ZFAND6, or ZFAND3 identified specific gene networks related to T2D pathophysiology. Finally, a positive correlation between the expression of Ins2 and the expression of Prc1, Srr, Zfand6, and Zfand3 was found in mouse pancreatic islets with altered beta-cell function.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the ability of post-GWAS functional studies to identify new genes and pathways involved in human pancreatic beta-cell function and in T2D pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Insulin resistance is a key event in type 2 diabetes onset and a major comorbidity of obesity. It results from a combination of fat excess–triggered defects, including lipotoxicity and metaflammation, but the causal mechanisms remain difficult to identify. Here, we report that hyperactivation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 found in Noonan syndrome (NS) led to an unsuspected insulin resistance profile uncoupled from altered lipid management (for example, obesity or ectopic lipid deposits) in both patients and mice. Functional exploration of an NS mouse model revealed this insulin resistance phenotype correlated with constitutive inflammation of tissues involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Bone marrow transplantation and macrophage depletion improved glucose homeostasis and decreased metaflammation in the mice, highlighting a key role of macrophages. In-depth analysis of bone marrow–derived macrophages in vitro and liver macrophages showed that hyperactive SHP2 promoted a proinflammatory phenotype, modified resident macrophage homeostasis, and triggered monocyte infiltration. Consistent with a role of SHP2 in promoting inflammation-driven insulin resistance, pharmaceutical SHP2 inhibition in obese diabetic mice improved insulin sensitivity even better than conventional antidiabetic molecules by specifically reducing metaflammation and alleviating macrophage activation. Together, these results reveal that SHP2 hyperactivation leads to inflammation-triggered metabolic impairments and highlight the therapeutical potential of SHP2 inhibition to ameliorate insulin resistance.},
