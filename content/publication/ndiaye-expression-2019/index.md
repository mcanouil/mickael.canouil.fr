abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 250 loci
  associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity. However, post-GWAS functional
  genomic investigations have been inadequate for understanding how these genetic
  loci physiologically impact disease development. We performed a PCR-free expression
  assay targeting genes located nearby the GWAS-identified SNPs associated with BMI/obesity
  in a large panel of human tissues. Furthermore, we analyzed several genetic risk
  scores (GRS) summing GWAS-identified alleles associated with increased BMI in 4236
  individuals. We found that the expression of BMI/obesity susceptibility genes was
  strongly enriched in the brain, especially in the insula (p = 4.7 × 10–9) and substantia
  nigra (p = 6.8 × 10–7), which are two brain regions involved in addiction and reward.
  Inversely, we found that top obesity/BMI-associated loci, including FTO, showed
  the strongest gene expression enrichment in the two brain regions. Our data suggest
  for the first time that the susceptibility genes for common obesity may have an
  effect on eating addiction and reward behaviors through their high expression in
  substantia nigra and insula, i.e., a different pattern from monogenic obesity genes
  that act in the hypothalamus and cause hyperphagia. Further epidemiological studies
  with relevant food behavior phenotypes are necessary to confirm these findings.
