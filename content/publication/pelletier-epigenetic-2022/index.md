abstract: |
    Excessive fetal growth is associated with DNA methylation alterations in
    human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), but their functional impact
    remains elusive. We implemented an integrative analysis combining single-cell epigenomics,
    single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro analyses to functionally link DNA methylation
    changes to putative alterations of HSPC functions. We showed in hematopoietic stem
    cells (HSC) from large for gestational age neonates that both DNA hypermethylation
    and chromatin rearrangements target a specific network of transcription factors
    known to sustain stem cell quiescence. In parallel, we found a decreased expression
    of key genes regulating HSC differentiation including EGR1, KLF2, SOCS3, and JUNB.
    Our functional analyses showed that this epigenetic programming was associated with
    a decreased ability for HSCs to remain quiescent. Taken together, our multimodal
    approach using single-cell (epi)genomics showed that human fetal overgrowth affects
    hematopoietic stem cells’ quiescence signaling via epigenetic programming.
