abstract: In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated
  with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we hypothesized that
  DNA methylome of livers from patients with T2D, when compared to livers of individuals
  with normal plasma glucose levels, can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin
  resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses
  of livers from obese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a CpG site
  in PDGFA (encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression
  are associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance
  and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies and human cell
  modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site
  hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from liver.
  We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein
  kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression
  of both insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte
  insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor
  inhibitors and by metformin opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in the liver
  of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin
  resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.
