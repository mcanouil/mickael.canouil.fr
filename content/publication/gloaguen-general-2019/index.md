abstract: Most genome-wide association studies used genetic-model-based tests assuming
  an additive mode of inheritance, leading to underpowered association tests in case
  of departure from additivity. The general regression model (GRM) association test
  proposed by Fisher and Wilson in 1980 makes no assumption on the genetic model.
  Interestingly, it also allows formal testing of the underlying genetic model. We
  conducted a simulation study of quantitative traits to compare the power of the
  GRM test to the classical linear regression tests, the maximum of the three statistics
  (MAX), and the allele-based (allelic) tests. Simulations were performed on two samples
  sizes, using a large panel of genetic models, varying genetic models, minor allele
  frequencies, and the percentage of explained variance. In case of departure from
  additivity, the GRM was more powerful than the additive regression tests (power
  gain reaching 80%) and had similar power when the true model is additive. GRM was
  also as or more powerful than the MAX or allelic tests. The true simulated model
  was mostly retained by the GRM test. Application of GRM to HbA1c illustrates its
  gain in power. To conclude, GRM increases power to detect association for quantitative
  traits, allows determining the genetic model and is easily applicable.
