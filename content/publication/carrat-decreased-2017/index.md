abstract: Genetic variants near ARAP1 (CENTD2) and STARD10 influence type 2 diabetes
  (T2D) risk. The risk alleles impair glucose-induced insulin secretion and, paradoxically
  but characteristically, are associated with decreased proinsulin:insulin ratios,
  indicating improved proinsulin conversion. Neither the identity of the causal variants
  nor the gene(s) through which risk is conferred have been firmly established. Whereas
  ARAP1 encodes a GTPase activating protein, STARD10 is a member of the steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer protein family. By integrating
  genetic fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation data and performing promoter-reporter
  and chromatin conformational capture (3C) studies in β cell lines, we localize the
  causal variant(s) at this locus to a 5 kb region that overlaps a stretch-enhancer
  active in islets. This region contains several highly correlated T2D-risk variants,
  including the rs140130268 indel. Expression QTL analysis of islet transcriptomes
  from three independent subject groups demonstrated that T2D-risk allele carriers
  displayed reduced levels of STARD10 mRNA, with no concomitant change in ARAP1 mRNA
  levels. Correspondingly, β-cell-selective deletion of StarD10 in mice led to impaired
  glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and insulin secretion and recapitulated the pattern
  of improved proinsulin processing observed at the human GWAS signal. Conversely,
  overexpression of StarD10 in the adult β cell improved glucose tolerance in high
  fat-fed animals. In contrast, manipulation of Arap1 in β cells had no impact on
  insulin secretion or proinsulin conversion in mice. This convergence of human and
  murine data provides compelling evidence that the T2D risk associated with variation
  at this locus is mediated through reduction in STARD10 expression in the β cell.
