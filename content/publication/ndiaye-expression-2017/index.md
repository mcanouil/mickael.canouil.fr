abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified textgreater100\
  \ loci independently contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. However, translational\
  \ implications for precision medicine and for the development of novel treatments\
  \ have been disappointing, due to poor knowledge of how these loci impact T2D pathophysiology.\
  \ Here, we aimed to measure the expression of genes located nearby T2D associated\
  \ signals and to assess their effect on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.\
  \ METHODS: The expression of 104 candidate T2D susceptibility genes was measured\
  \ in a human multi-tissue panel, through PCR-free expression assay. The effects\
  \ of the knockdown of beta-cell enriched genes were next investigated on insulin\
  \ secretion from the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line. Finally, we performed RNA-sequencing\
  \ (RNA-seq) so as to assess the pathways affected by the knockdown of the new genes\
  \ impacting insulin secretion from EndoC-βH1, and we analyzed the expression of\
  \ the new genes in mouse models with altered pancreatic beta-cell function. RESULTS:\
  \ We found that the candidate T2D susceptibility genes' expression is significantly\
  \ enriched in pancreatic beta cells obtained by laser capture microdissection or\
  \ sorted by flow cytometry and in EndoC-βH1 cells, but not in insulin sensitive\
  \ tissues. Furthermore, the knockdown of seven T2D-susceptibility genes (CDKN2A,\
  \ GCK, HNF4A, KCNK16, SLC30A8, TBC1D4, and TCF19) with already known expression\
  \ and/or function in beta cells changed insulin secretion, supporting our functional\
  \ approach. We showed first evidence for a role in insulin secretion of four candidate\
  \ T2D-susceptibility genes (PRC1, SRR, ZFAND3, and ZFAND6) with no previous knowledge\
  \ of presence and function in beta cells. RNA-seq in EndoC-βH1 cells with decreased\
  \ expression of PRC1, SRR, ZFAND6, or ZFAND3 identified specific gene networks related\
  \ to T2D pathophysiology. Finally, a positive correlation between the expression\
  \ of Ins2 and the expression of Prc1, Srr, Zfand6, and Zfand3 was found in mouse\
  \ pancreatic islets with altered beta-cell function. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed\
  \ the ability of post-GWAS functional studies to identify new genes and pathways\
  \ involved in human pancreatic beta-cell function and in T2D pathophysiology."
