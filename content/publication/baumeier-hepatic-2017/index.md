abstract: Hepatic DPP4 expression is elevated in subjects with ectopic fat accumulation
  in the liver. However, whether increased dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is involved
  in the pathogenesis or is rather a consequence of metabolic disease is not known.
  We therefore studied the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice
  prone to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of hepatic
  Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain, independent of liver fat content.
  In the same animals, methylation of four intronic CpG sites was decreased, amplifying
  glucose-induced transcription of hepatic Dpp4 In older mice, hepatic triglyceride
  content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression. Expression
  and release of DPP4 were markedly higher in the liver compared with adipose depots.
  Analysis of human liver biopsy specimens revealed a correlation of DPP4 expression
  and DNA methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
  In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of the liver in participation to
  systemic DPP4 levels. Furthermore, the data show that glucose-induced expression
  of Dpp4 in the liver is facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life.
  This might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which in turn
  result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in life.
