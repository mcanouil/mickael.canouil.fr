abstract: Insulin resistance is a key event in type 2 diabetes onset and a major comorbidity
  of obesity. It results from a combination of fat excess–triggered defects, including
  lipotoxicity and metaflammation, but the causal mechanisms remain difficult to identify.
  Here, we report that hyperactivation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 found in Noonan
  syndrome (NS) led to an unsuspected insulin resistance profile uncoupled from altered
  lipid management (for example, obesity or ectopic lipid deposits) in both patients
  and mice. Functional exploration of an NS mouse model revealed this insulin resistance
  phenotype correlated with constitutive inflammation of tissues involved in the regulation
  of glucose metabolism. Bone marrow transplantation and macrophage depletion improved
  glucose homeostasis and decreased metaflammation in the mice, highlighting a key
  role of macrophages. In-depth analysis of bone marrow–derived macrophages in vitro
  and liver macrophages showed that hyperactive SHP2 promoted a proinflammatory phenotype,
  modified resident macrophage homeostasis, and triggered monocyte infiltration. Consistent
  with a role of SHP2 in promoting inflammation-driven insulin resistance, pharmaceutical
  SHP2 inhibition in obese diabetic mice improved insulin sensitivity even better
  than conventional antidiabetic molecules by specifically reducing metaflammation
  and alleviating macrophage activation. Together, these results reveal that SHP2
  hyperactivation leads to inflammation-triggered metabolic impairments and highlight
  the therapeutical potential of SHP2 inhibition to ameliorate insulin resistance.
