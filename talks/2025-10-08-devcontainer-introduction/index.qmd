  Introduction to Development Containers.
  An introduction to using development containers for reproducible development environments.
abstract: |
  In this talk, I introduce development containers (devcontainers) as a modern approach to creating consistent, reproducible development environments.
  Development containers provide a way to define your entire development environment as code, making it easy to share configurations and ensure all team members work with identical setups.
