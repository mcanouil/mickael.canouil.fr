  My Journey To Transparency And Reproducibility.</br>
  A journey towards a more transparent and reproducible work environment using Docker and `renv`.
abstract: In this talk, I (Mickaël CANOUIL) will chronicle my journey towards a more transparent and reproducible work environment. I will talk about the changes and improvements that I have implemented in my team, detailing the transition of infrastructure used when I arrived to an infrastructure using Docker and and the `renv` R package.
