A new blog post of the "Quarto Q&A" series.  
This time, I will show how to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container as light as possible.

## The Question/Problem

There are different ways to publish a Quarto project, either if it is a document, a book or a website:

- [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html),
- [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html),
- [Posit Connect](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html),
- [Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html),
- [Confluence](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html).

But, what if you want to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container, as an app?

## The Answer/Solution

Again, there are several ways to do it.
I will show you one way to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container, as light as possible.
To do so, I will use a Dockerfile with staged builds and a Quarto website project.

### Create a project

First, I create a website using the Quarto CLI and add a code cell to the `about.qmd` file that uses the `palmerpenguins` {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} package.  
I will publish this Quarto project as a Docker container.

```bash
quarto create-project --type website:blog mywebsite
cd mywebsite
echo '```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```' >> about.qmd
```

### `renv`

_See <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/>._

#### Setup `renv`

I am using `renv` to record the dependencies of the project[^renv-deps].  

[^renv-deps]: See [`renv` documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#snapshotting-dependencies) for more information on snapshotting dependencies.

```bash
echo 'library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)' >> _dependencies.R
Rscript -e 'install.packages("renv")' -e "renv::init()"
Rscript -e "renv::hydrate()" -e "renv::snapshot()"
```

#### The Dockerfile

Here, I am using "build arguments" (_i.e._, `ARGS`) to specify the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) and the {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} versions.  
This allows to change the versions without having to change the Dockerfile itself.

```bash
ARG QUARTO_VERSION="1.3.340"

FROM ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:${QUARTO_VERSION} AS builder             # <1>

ARG RIG_VERSION="latest"
ARG R_VERSION="release"
COPY install-rig.sh /tmp/install-rig.sh
RUN bash /tmp/install-rig.sh "${RIG_VERSION}"                           # <2>
RUN rig add ${R_VERSION} && Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install("renv")'       # <3>

COPY mywebsite /app                                                     # <4>
WORKDIR /app
RUN Rscript -e "renv::restore()"
RUN quarto render .                                                     # <5>

FROM httpd:alpine                                                       # <6>
COPY --from=builder /app/_site/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/              # <7>
```
1. The base Docker image used as the "_builder_", _i.e._,
   the image with all requirements to build your Quarto project.
   Here it is the Quarto image which is an Ubuntu based image with Quarto pre-installed.  
   The "_builder_" stage is used to install the specified `rig` and {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} version,
   and to render the website.
2. The `install-rig.sh` script is used to install the `rig` software.
3. Using `rig`, we add the specified {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} version and install the `renv` package.
4. Copy the Quarto project into the `/app` directory of the "_builder_".
5. Restore the `lockfile` created with `pak` and render the website with Quarto CLI.
6. The second and last stage is based on the `httpd:alpine` image which is a light image with Apache pre-installed.
7. Copy the rendered website from the "_builder_" to the `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` directory of the second stage image.

### `pak`

_See <https://pak.r-lib.org/>._

#### Setup `pak`

Alternatively to `renv`, it's also possible de record (and restore) the dependencies of a project[^pak-deps].

[^pak-deps]: See [`pak` documentation](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#lock-files) for more information on snapshotting dependencies.

```bash
Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))'
Rscript -e 'pak::lockfile_create(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "ggplot2", "palmerpenguins"))'
```

#### The Dockerfile  

Again, I am using "build arguments" (_i.e._, `ARGS`) to specify the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) and the {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} versions.  
This allows to change the versions without having to change the Dockerfile.

```bash
ARG QUARTO_VERSION="1.3.340"

FROM ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:${QUARTO_VERSION} AS builder             # <1>

ARG RIG_VERSION="latest"
ARG R_VERSION="release"
COPY install-rig.sh /tmp/install-rig.sh
RUN bash /tmp/install-rig.sh "${RIG_VERSION}"                           # <2>
RUN rig add ${R_VERSION}                                                # <3>

COPY mywebsite /app                                                     # <4>
WORKDIR /app
RUN Rscript -e "pak::lockfile_install()" && quarto render .             # <5>

FROM httpd:alpine                                                       # <6>
COPY --from=builder /app/_site/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/              # <7>
```
1. The base Docker image used as the "_builder_", _i.e._,
   the image with all requirements to build your Quarto project.
   Here it is the Quarto image which is an Ubuntu based image with Quarto pre-installed.  
   The "_builder_" stage is used to install the specified `rig` and {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} version,
   and to render the website.
2. The `install-rig.sh` script is used to install the `rig` software.
3. Using `rig`, we add the specified {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}} version which already includes `pak`.
4. Copy the Quarto project into the `/app` directory of the "_builder_".
5. Restore the `lockfile` created with `pak` and render the website with Quarto CLI.
6. The second and last stage is based on the `httpd:alpine` image which is a light image with Apache pre-installed.
7. Copy the rendered website from the "_builder_" to the `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` directory of the second stage image.

### Build the image

It's time to build the image using the Dockerfile and the [`docker buildx build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/) command.

```bash
docker buildx build \
--platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <1>
--build-arg QUARTO_VERSION=1.3.340 \                                  # <2>
--tag "mywebsite:1.0.0" \                                             # <3>
--push \                                                              # <4>
.
```
1. The platform to build the image for.
2. The Quarto version to use when building the image.
3. The tag to use to label the image, _i.e._, the name `mywebsite` and the version `1.0.0`.
   This is useful to be able to identify the image later.
4. (Optional) Assuming you have access to a registry (`docker login`),
   push the image to the registry, such as Docker Hub.

### Deploy a container

Finally, deploying locally the image as a Docker container using [`docker container run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_run/) and access the website from your browser at <http://localhost:8080>.

```bash
docker container run \
   --detach \                                                            # <1>
   --platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <2>
   --name mywebsite \                                                    # <3>
   --publish 8080:80 \                                                   # <4>
   mywebsite:1.0.0                                                       # <5>
```
1. The container in detached mode, _i.e._, the container runs in the background.
2. The platform to run the container on, _i.e._, same as the platform used to build the image in this case.
3. The name of the container for easy identification, _i.e._, `mywebsite`.
4. The port mapping, _i.e._, we publish the port `8080` of the host to the port `80` of the container.
   This is useful to be able to access the website from the host.
5. The image to use to run the container, _i.e._, `mywebsite:1.0.0`.
