A new blog post of the "Quarto Q&A" series.  
This time, I will show how to have images both for light and dark theme, when switching between them.

## The Question/Problem

When you build a website with Quarto, you can use the `theme` option
to specify the theme you want to use for `light` and `dark` mode[^1].

[^1]: See <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#dark-mode>.

```yml
theme:
  light: united
  dark: slate
```

However, if you want to have images for both themes, you need to have two versions of the same image,
one for `light` and one for `dark` mode.
But how can you do that and how can you switch between them automatically?

## The Answer/Solution

Let's use `knitr` as the engine to generate the images.
For example, you can use `svglite` to generate SVG images and/or any custom `knitr` handler.

1. Set the `dev` option to use `svglite` for `light` mode and `darksvglite` for `dark` mode and `fig.ext` to set the generated images extensions.
   ```{.yaml include="assets/_demo.qmd" start-line=11 end-line=14}
   ```
2. Create `ggplot2` themes for `light` and `dark` images.

   ::: {.panel-tabset}
   ## Light

   ```{.r include="assets/_demo.qmd" start-line=23 end-line=38}
   ```
   
   ## Dark

   ```{.r include="assets/_demo.qmd" start-line=40 end-line=55}
   ```
   :::
3. Create a new function to save the `dark` images.
   ```{.r include="assets/_demo.qmd" start-line=57 end-line=67}
   ```
4. The `ggplot2` code to build an image.
   ```{.r include="assets/_demo.qmd" start-line=75 end-line=92}
   ```
5. The JavaScript code to switch between the two images (_i.e._, `.light.svg` and `.dark.svg`).
   <details><summary>JavaScript code</summary>
   ```{.javascript include="assets/light-dark.js"}
   ```
   </details>
6. Finally, the whole Quarto document code.
   <details><summary>Quarto document code</summary>
   ```{.md include="assets/_demo.qmd"}
   ```
   </details>

   ![**Dark** mode **ON**](assets/dark.png){fig-alt='Scatter plot on a dark background width dark mode switched on.' fig-align=center}
