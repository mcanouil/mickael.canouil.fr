A new blog post of the "Quarto Q&A" series.  
This time, I will show how to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container as light as possible.

## The Question/Problem

There are different ways to publish your Quarto project, either if is a document, a book or a website:

- [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html),
- [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html),
- [Posit Connect](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html),
- [Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html),
- [Confluence](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html).

But what if you want to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container? As an app?

## The Answer/Solution

Again, there are several ways to do it, but I will show you the steps/principles to publish your Quarto project as a Docker container as light as possible.
To do so, I will use a Dockerfile with staged builds.

### `renv` (<https://rstudio.github.io/renv/>)

#### Create a project

For example, create a website using the Quarto CLI and add a code cell to the `about.qmd` file that uses the `palmerpenguins` R package.

```bash
quarto create-project --type website:blog mywebsite
cd mywebsite
echo '```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```' >> about.qmd
```

#### Setup `renv`

Setup `renv` and snapshot the dependencies in the `_dependencies.R` file.  
See [`renv` documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#snapshotting-dependencies) for more information on snapshotting dependencies.

```bash
echo 'library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)' >> _dependencies.R
Rscript -e 'install.packages("renv")' -e "renv::init()"
Rscript -e "renv::hydrate()" -e "renv::snapshot()"
```

#### The Dockerfile

Here, I added "build arguments" (_i.e._, `ARGS`) to specify the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) and the R versions.

```bash
ARG QUARTO_VERSION="1.3.340"

FROM ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:${QUARTO_VERSION} AS builder             # <1>

ARG RIG_VERSION="latest"
ARG R_VERSION="release"
COPY install-rig.sh /tmp/install-rig.sh
RUN bash /tmp/install-rig.sh "${RIG_VERSION}"                           # <2>
RUN rig add ${R_VERSION} && Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install("renv")'       # <3>

COPY mywebsite /app                                                     # <4>
WORKDIR /app
RUN Rscript -e "renv::restore()"
RUN quarto render .                                                     # <5>

FROM httpd:alpine                                                       # <6>
COPY --from=builder /app/_site/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/              # <7>
```
1. The base Docker image use to be the builder, here it is the Quarto image which is Ubuntu based image with Quarto pre-installed.  
   The `builder` stage is used to install the `rig` and the specified R version, and to render the website.
2. The `install-rig.sh` script is used to install the `rig` software.
3. Using `rig`, we add the specified R version and install the `renv` package.
4. We copy the Quarto project into the `/app` directory of the builder.
5. We restore the `renv` environment and render the website.
6. The second and last stage is the `httpd:alpine` image which is a light image with Apache pre-installed.  
7. We copy the rendered website from the `builder` to the `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` directory of the second stage.

#### Build the image

```bash
docker buildx build \
--platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <1>
--build-arg QUARTO_VERSION=1.3.340 \                                  # <2>
--tag "mywebsite:1.0.0" \                                             # <3>
.
```
1. We specify the platform to build the image for.
2. We specify the Quarto version to use during the build.
3. We tag the image with the name `mywebsite` and the version `1.0.0`.
   This is useful to be able to identify the image later.

#### Share the image

To share the image with others[^1] or deploy it locally:

```bash
docker container run \
   --detach \                                                            # <1>
   --platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <2>
   --name mywebsite \                                                    # <3>
   --publish 8080:80 \                                                   # <4>
   mywebsite:1.0.0                                                       # <5>
```
1. We run the container in detached mode.
2. We specify the platform to define the architecture of the container, thus the image to use.
3. We name the container `mywebsite`, to ease identification.
4. We publish the port `8080` of the host to the port `80` of the container.
   This is useful to be able to access the website from the host.
5. We specify the image to use.

### `pak` (<https://pak.r-lib.org/>)

#### Create a project

For example, create a website using the Quarto CLI and add a code cell to the `about.qmd` file that uses the `palmerpenguins` R package.

```bash
quarto create-project --type website:blog mywebsite
cd mywebsite
echo '```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```' >> about.qmd
```

#### Setup `pak`

Setup `pak` `lockfile` to record the dependencies (see [`pak` documentation](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#lock-files) for more information on snapshotting dependencies).

```bash
Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))'
Rscript -e 'pak::lockfile_create(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "ggplot2", "palmerpenguins"))'
```

#### The Dockerfile  

Here, I added "build arguments" (_i.e._, `ARGS`) to specify the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) and the R versions.

```bash
ARG QUARTO_VERSION="1.3.340"

FROM ghcr.io/quarto-dev/quarto:${QUARTO_VERSION} AS builder             # <1>

ARG RIG_VERSION="latest"
ARG R_VERSION="release"
COPY install-rig.sh /tmp/install-rig.sh
RUN bash /tmp/install-rig.sh "${RIG_VERSION}"                           # <2>
RUN rig add ${R_VERSION}                                                # <3>

COPY mywebsite /app                                                     # <4>
WORKDIR /app
RUN Rscript -e "pak::lockfile_install()" && quarto render .             # <5>

FROM httpd:alpine                                                       # <6>
COPY --from=builder /app/_site/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/              # <7>
```
1. The base Docker image use to be the builder, here it is the Quarto image which is Ubuntu based image with Quarto pre-installed.  
   The `builder` stage is used to install the `rig` and the specified R version, and to render the website.
2. The `install-rig.sh` script is used to install the `rig` software.
3. Using `rig`, we add the specified R version which already includes `pak`.
4. We copy the Quarto project into the `/app` directory of the builder.
5. We restore the `pak` `lockfile` and render the website.
6. The second and last stage is the `httpd:alpine` image which is a light image with Apache pre-installed.  
   We copy the rendered website from the `builder` to the `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` directory of the second stage.

#### Build the image

```bash
docker buildx build \
   --platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <1>
   --build-arg QUARTO_VERSION=1.3.340 \                                  # <2>
   --tag "mywebsite:1.0.0" \                                             # <3>
   .
```
1. We specify the platform to build the image for.
2. We specify the Quarto version to use during the build.
3. We tag the image with the name `mywebsite` and the version `1.0.0`.
   This is useful to be able to identify the image later.

```bash
docker container run \
   --detach \                                                            # <1>
   --platform "linux/amd64" \                                            # <2>
   --name mywebsite \                                                    # <3>
   --publish 8080:80 \                                                   # <4>
   mywebsite:1.0.0                                                       # <5>
```
1. We run the container in detached mode.
2. We specify the platform to define the architecture of the container, thus the image to use.
3. We name the container `mywebsite`, to ease identification.
4. We publish the port `8080` of the host to the port `80` of the container.
   This is useful to be able to access the website from the host.
5. We specify the image to use.

## Finally

View the website locally at <http://localhost:8080>.

[^1]: Add the `--push` flag to the `docker buildx build` command to push the image to a registry.  
Assuming you have access to the registry (`docker login`), you can then share the image with others.
