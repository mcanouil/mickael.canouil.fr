## Introduction

Welcome to a new era of presentation design—one where your slides not only inform but captivate.
With Quarto's Reveal.js format, you can step away from the mundane and deliver an experience that truly resonates.

In this post, you'll learn how to:

1. Craft mesmerizing tabset navigation that flows as naturally as your ideas.
2. Transform your interactive presentations into sleek, professionally polished PDFs.

Let's dive in and start elevating your slide game!

## Setting Up the Presentation

Let's kick off by creating a basic Reveal.js presentation with the essential YAML header.

```{.yaml include="assets/_demo-default.qmd" start-line=2 end-line=7}
```

## Structuring Your Content

Break free from linear storytelling by organizing your slides into engaging segments.
Use the `.panel-tabset` class in your markdown content to create a dynamic, tabbed interface that keeps your audience on the edge of their seats:

```{.markdown include="assets/_demo-default.qmd" start-line=10 end-line=40 shortcodes="false"}
```

## Default Navigation Limitations

Out of the box, Quarto's default configuration requires a manual click on every tab—a small, yet frustrating interruption in the flow of your presentation.
Imagine having to constantly click through your content when you could be gliding from idea to idea!

```{bash}
#| label: quarto-render-default
#| include: false
#| echo: false
quarto render assets/_demo-default.qmd --to revealjs --embed-resources
```

```{.bash}
quarto render assets/_demo-default.qmd
```

{{< revealjs "assets/_demo-default.html" full-screen-link="false" >}}

## Enhanced Tabset Navigation

What if you could navigate through your tabs with the fluid grace of arrow keys? Inspired by [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/)'s Slidecraft [Slidecraft 101: Fragments - JS](https://emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-fragment-js/#tabset-advance), I've taken tabset navigation to the next level with a custom JavaScript solution.

Here's how you can make your presentation navigation as smooth as silk:

1. **Create a Custom JavaScript stored as an HTML file.**  
   Save[^1] the following code snippet in an HTML file.
   This script leverages Reveal.js's fragment feature to enable arrow key navigation, letting you effortlessly glide between your tabs as if they were different slides.

   ```{.html include="assets/revealjs-tabset.html" start-line=25 end-line=63}
   ```

2. **Embed the Script in Your YAML Header.**  
   Integrate this new functionality by including the script in your Quarto presentation's YAML header:

   ```{.yaml include="assets/_demo-tabset.qmd" start-line=2 end-line=10}
   ```

[^1]: Or download the file directly using the link under the table of contents.

```{bash}
#| label: quarto-render-tabset
#| include: false
#| echo: false
quarto render assets/_demo-tabset.qmd --to revealjs --embed-resources
```

Render your updated slides and experience a newfound freedom in navigation:

```{.bash}
quarto render assets/_demo-tabset.qmd
```

Now, simply use the left and right arrow keys to seamlessly transition between tabs—it's like your presentation has its own rhythm!

{{< revealjs "assets/_demo-tabset.html" full-screen-link="false" >}}

## Exporting to PDF

To export your presentation to PDF, you can use the [`decktape` tool](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape), which is a headless Chrome utility for capturing web pages as PDFs.

Your interactive masterpiece deserves to be preserved. With the [`decktape` tool](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape), you can convert your dynamic Reveal.js  slides into a beautifully formatted PDF that retains every engaging detail and nuance of your presentation.

1. Install `decktape` using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

   ```{.bash filename="bash"}
   npm install -g decktape
   ```

2. Use the following command to generate a PDF from your Reveal.js presentation:

   ```{.bash filename="bash"}
   npx -y decktape reveal \
     --chrome-arg=--no-sandbox \
     --chrome-arg=--disable-setuid-sandbox \
     --fragments \
     "my-slides.html" "my-slides.pdf"
   ```

This command ensures every fragment and tab is captured in the PDF, preserving the aesthetic and functionality of your presentation.

```{bash}
#| label: decktape
#| include: false
#| echo: false
for file in "_demo-default" "_demo-tabset"; do
  npx -y decktape reveal \
    --chrome-arg=--no-sandbox \
    --chrome-arg=--disable-setuid-sandbox \
    --fragments \
    "assets/${file}.html" "assets/${file}.pdf"
done
```
