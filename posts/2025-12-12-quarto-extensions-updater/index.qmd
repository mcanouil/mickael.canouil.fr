Managing dependencies is a cornerstone of modern software development, and Dependabot has long been the gold standard for automating dependency updates in GitHub repositories.
But what about Quarto extensions?

I'm thrilled to introduce **[Quarto Extensions Updater](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-extensions-updater) 1.0.0**, a GitHub Action that brings Dependabot-style automation to Quarto extension management.
If you maintain Quarto projects with multiple extensions, this tool will transform your maintenance workflow from tedious manual checks into an effortless, automated process.

:::: {.highlight}

**Quarto Extensions Updater 1.0.0** brings **Dependabot-style automation** to Quarto extension management.
**Set it and forget it**.

:::

## Key Features

**Quarto Extensions Updater** automates the entire extension update workflow:

- **🔍 Automatic Detection**: Scans your `_extensions/` directory to discover all installed extensions.
- **📦 Smart Updates**: Uses the Quarto CLI (`quarto add`) to update extensions with proper dependency resolution.
- **🔄 Source Tracking**: Maintains the `source` field in extension manifests for reliable version management[^1].
- **📝 Detailed Pull Requests**: Creates PRs with comprehensive release notes, categorised by update type (major, minor, patch).
- **🔀 One PR Per Extension**: Each extension gets its own pull request that updates when new versions are available.
- **🏷️ Semantic Versioning**: Automatically categorises updates and adds appropriate labels.
- **⚡ Flexible Scheduling**: Run daily, weekly, monthly, or manually via workflow dispatch.
- **⚙️ Highly Customisable**: Configure branch names, commit messages, PR titles, and labels to match your workflow.

[^1]: Quarto CLI does not natively track installation sources as of version 1.8.24. See [quarto-dev/quarto-cli#11468](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11468).

:::: {.highlight}

Each extension gets its **own dedicated pull request** that **automatically updates** when new versions are available.
No more blocked PRs!

:::

## Getting Started

Create a workflow file in your repository:

```{.yaml filename=".github/workflows/update-extensions.yml"}
name: Update Quarto Extensions

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # <1>
  workflow_dispatch: # <2>

permissions:
  contents: write # <3>
  pull-requests: write # <4>

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Quarto # <5>
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - uses: mcanouil/quarto-extensions-updater@v1 # <6>
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

1. Runs daily at midnight UTC.
   Adjust the cron schedule to suit your needs (weekly: `0 0 * * 0`, monthly: `0 0 1 * *`).
2. Allows manual triggering from the Actions tab.
3. Required to create branches and commit changes.
4. Required to create and update pull requests.
5. Installs Quarto CLI, which is required for the `quarto add` command.
6. Runs the updater with default settings.

:::: {.callout-tip}

## First Time Setup

The action works best with extensions that have proper `source` metadata in their `_extension.yml` files.
If you installed extensions using [Quarto Wizard](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-wizard), this metadata is already present.
Otherwise, you can manually add it:

```{.yaml filename="_extensions/owner/name/_extension.yml"}
title: "Extension Name"
version: "1.0.0"
source: "owner/repository@v1.0.0" # <1>
```

1. Add or update this line to enable tracking.

## Configuration Options

The action supports extensive customisation through input parameters:

| Input                   | Description                                              | Required | Default                                                                                                        |

| `create-pr`             | Whether to create pull requests                          | No       | `true`                                                                                                         |
| `branch-prefix`         | Prefix for update branches                               | No       | `chore/quarto-extensions`                                                                                      |
| `base-branch`           | Target branch for pull requests                          | No       | `main`                                                                                                         |

The action also provides output values:

| Output              | Description                                                 |

| `pr-number`         | Pull request number (if created)                            |
| `pr-url`            | Pull request URL (if created)                               |

:::: {.callout-note}

## Conventional Commits Integration

Using conventional commits?
Customise the prefixes to match your workflow:

```{.yaml}
- uses: mcanouil/quarto-extensions-updater@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    branch-prefix: "deps/quarto"
    pr-title-prefix: "build(deps):"
    commit-message-prefix: "build(deps):"
    pr-labels: "dependencies,quarto,automated"
```

This creates PRs with titles like `build(deps): update owner/name extension to 1.2.3`.

:::

## How It Works

The action follows a systematic workflow:

1. **Fetch Registry**: Downloads the [Quarto Extensions registry](https://m.canouil.dev/quarto-extensions/) from GitHub.
2. **Scan Extensions**: Discovers all installed extensions in your `_extensions/` directory.
3. **Check Versions**: Compares installed versions with the registry using semantic versioning.
4. **Process Each Extension**: Processes extensions individually to create separate pull requests.
5. **Apply Updates**: Uses the Quarto CLI (`quarto add owner/repo@version --no-prompt`) to update extensions.
6. **Track Updates**: Maintains or adds the `source` field in extension manifests.
7. **Create/Update PR**:
   - Creates a new pull request if none exists for the extension.
   - Updates the existing PR if one already exists (same branch name).
   - Ensures at most one PR per extension.

## Understanding Pull Requests

The action creates detailed, informative pull requests that follow Dependabot's style:

````markdown
Updates the following Quarto extension(s):

## ✨ Minor Updates

- **[mcanouil/quarto-iconify](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify)**: `1.0.0` → `3.0.1`

## Requirements

:::: {.callout-important}

## Essential Requirements

Before using the action, ensure:

1. **Quarto CLI**: Must be installed in the workflow environment.
   Use `quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2` to install Quarto in GitHub Actions.
2. **Extension Structure**: Extensions should be in `_extensions/owner/name/` structure with `_extension.yml` or `_extension.yaml` files.
3. **Semantic Versioning**: Extension versions should follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z).
4. **Registry Listing**: Extensions should be listed in the [Quarto Extensions registry](https://m.canouil.dev/quarto-extensions/).
5. **Permissions**: Workflow needs `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions.
6. **Source Metadata**: Extensions should have `source` fields in their manifests for reliable version tracking.

:::

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **No Updates Detected**: Verify extensions are in [m.canouil.dev/quarto-extensions/](https://m.canouil.dev/quarto-extensions/) and have version and source fields in their manifests.
- **Permission Errors**: Check that workflow has `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions.
- **Workflow Not Running**: Verify cron syntax and ensure GitHub Actions are enabled.
  GitHub disables scheduled workflows in inactive repositories after 60 days.
- **Duplicate PRs**: Ensure `branch-prefix` is consistent across workflow runs.

Check the [GitHub Actions logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs) for detailed error messages.

## Ecosystem Integration

**Quarto Extensions Updater** complements existing tools in the Quarto ecosystem:

- **[Quarto Wizard](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-wizard)**: A VS Code extension for installing and managing Quarto extensions with a GUI.
  Extensions installed via Quarto Wizard include the `source` metadata needed for automated updates.
- **[Quarto Extensions](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-extensions)**: The community registry that powers both Quarto Wizard and Quarto Extensions Updater.
- **[Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/)**: The action uses `quarto add` commands to perform updates, ensuring compatibility with Quarto's extension system.
