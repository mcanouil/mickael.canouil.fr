  Screenshot of an html rendered by Quarto. it starts with a sentence saying below are several tables by species of penguins, followed by an item list showing the species and their respective cross-reference to the tables.
  Tables are simply on top of each other after the item list.

I decided to start small blog posts with answers/solutions to questions I have seen and answered on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues) & [Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions).

## The Question/Problem

> Suppose, in a #QuartoPub document, using #rStats I have a list of length G, each item in this list is a flextable - I need to use flextable as opposed to kable, to allow for output to docx.
> G is unknown apriori, but will be at least 1.
>
> Is there any way to create a sequence of tables with associated labels and captions that could be worked out dynamically/parsed? 
> Manually, this can be done really easily (creating new labels etc) and knowing when to stop, but is there a way of automating this?

## The Answer/Solution

The trick is, within a code cell with `output: asis`, to use `knitr::knit_child()` to create code cells with `label`, caption (`tbl-cap`), or whatever option you might want or need.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| classes: panel-tabset
cat("\n\n## Quarto Input\n\n")
cat(
  "\n````md",
  readLines("assets/_demo.qmd"),
  "````\n",
  sep = "\n"
)
# system2("quarto", c("render", "assets/_demo.qmd"))
# devnull <- webshot2::webshot(
#   url = "assets/_demo.html",
#   file = "featured.png",
#   vwidth = 1920 * 1.4,
#   vheight = 1080 * 1.4,
#   cliprect = "viewport"
# )
cat("\n\n## Quarto Output\n\n")
fig_alt <- "Screenshot of an html rendered by Quarto. it starts with a sentence saying below are several tables by species of penguins, followed by an item list showing the species and their respective cross-reference to the tables.
Tables are simply on top of each other after the item list."
cat(sprintf("![](%s){fig-alt='%s'}", "featured.png", fig_alt))
```
