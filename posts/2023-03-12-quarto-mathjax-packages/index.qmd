A second blog post of the "Quarto Q&A" series.  
This time, I will show how to activate additional MathJax packages in a Quarto document.

## The Question/Problem

Sometimes you want to use additional MathJax packages in a Quarto document, such as being able to use `\qty` from `physics` or upper/lower case Greek letters from `upgreek`.

## The Answer/Solution

The solution is to load the additional packages in the `include-in-header` key of the YAML header, using JavaScript as documented on MathJax documentation.  
You can load several packages at once, as shown in the example below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| classes: panel-tabset
cat("\n\n## Quarto Input\n\n")
cat(
  "\n````md",
  readLines("assets/_demo.qmd"),
  "````\n",
  sep = "\n"
)
# system2("quarto", c("render", "assets/_demo.qmd"))
# devnull <- webshot2::webshot(
#   url = "assets/_demo.html",
#   file = "assets/output.png",
#   vwidth = 1920 * 0.25,
#   vheight = 1080 * 0.25,
#   cliprect = "viewport",
#   zoom = 4
# )
cat("\n\n## Quarto Output\n\n")
fig_alt <- "Screenshot of an html rendered by Quarto. It contains Quarto MathJax as a title, followed by an equation of rank bold upper sigma."
cat(sprintf("![](%s){fig-alt='%s'}", "output.png", fig_alt))
```
