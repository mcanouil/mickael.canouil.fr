After years of working with Quarto in both VS Code and Positron, I've refined a set of editor settings that significantly improve my document editing experience.
These configurations address common pain points like div folding, Git diff readability, and workspace performance.

:::: {.highlight}

The path to **effortless editing** is paved with **thoughtful settings**.

:::

Whether you're just starting with Quarto or looking to optimise your existing setup, these settings can help streamline your workflow and reduce friction in your daily editing tasks.

## Core Quarto Settings

The foundation of my configuration lies in language-specific settings for Quarto documents.
These settings ensure consistent formatting and provide visual aids for working with Quarto.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
  "[quarto]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "quarto.quarto",        // <1>
    "editor.wordWrap": "off",                          // <2>
    "editor.guides.bracketPairs": "active",            // <3>
    "editor.language.brackets": [["::::", ":::"]],     // <4>
    "editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs": [         // <5>
      ["::::", ":::"]
    ]
  }
}
```

1. Uses the official Quarto extension as the default formatter for Quarto files, ensuring consistent formatting of code blocks and code cells.
2. Disables word wrapping to prevent markdown pipe tables from wrapping awkwardly.
3. Shows bracket pair guides only for the active bracket pair, reducing visual clutter whilst maintaining helpful structural indicators.
4. Defines Quarto's div syntax (`::::` for opening, `:::` for closing) as bracket pairs, enabling folding and navigation.[^div-syntax]
5. Adds colourisation to div brackets, making it easier to match opening and closing divs in deeply nested structures.

[^div-syntax]: Whilst Pandoc's div syntax doesn't require matching numbers of colons for opening and closing divs (see [Pandoc Manual: Extension fenced_divs](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_divs)), using four colons for opening and three for closing provides clear visual distinction and enables better editor support.

:::: {.callout-tip}

Disabling word wrap setting might seem counter-intuitive, but by keeping one sentence per line, Git diffs show exactly which sentences changed rather than displaying entire paragraph modifications.
This also prevents markdown pipe tables from wrapping mid-cell, which can break table rendering.

## Visual Line Length Guides

To maintain readable line lengths whilst avoiding word wrap, I use vertical rulers as visual guides.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
  "editor.rulers": [
    80,                                                // <1>
    {
      "color": "#b22222",                            // <2>
      "column": 120                                    // <3>
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Displays a subtle vertical line at 80 characters, serving as a soft guideline for line length.
2. Sets a firebrick red colour for the second ruler to draw attention to excessively long lines.
3. Places the warning ruler at 120 characters, indicating lines that should ideally be broken up.

This two-ruler approach provides progressive feedback: the first ruler suggests an ideal/standard line length, whilst the second warns when lines become problematically long.

## Workspace Performance Optimisation

Quarto projects generate substantial build artefacts in the `.quarto` directory.
Excluding this directory from file watching and search operations improves editor performance, especially in large projects.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.quarto/**": true                              // <1>
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "*/.quarto": true                                  // <2>
  }
}
```

1. Prevents the editor from monitoring changes in `.quarto` directories, reducing unnecessary file system operations and improving responsiveness.
2. Excludes `.quarto` directories from search results, eliminating irrelevant build artefacts from workspace searches.

These exclusions are particularly beneficial in projects with frequent renders or when working with large documents that generate extensive intermediate files.

:::: {.callout-tip}

Another directory to consider excluding is the `_freeze` directory if you're using the freeze feature extensively, as this can also contain a large number of files.
You can also exclude other render output directories specific to your workflow, such as `_site`, `_book`, and `_manuscript`.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

The Quarto extension disables GitHub Copilot by default for Quarto files.[^copilot-default]
If you want to use GitHub Copilot's AI assistance whilst editing Quarto documents, you must explicitly enable it in your settings.

```{.json filename="settings.json"}
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "quarto": true                                     // <1>
  }
}
```

1. Overrides the Quarto extension's default behaviour to enable GitHub Copilot suggestions in Quarto documents.

[^copilot-default]: The Quarto extension disables Copilot by default in its configuration (see [quarto-dev/quarto#621](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto/issues/621) and [package.json](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto/blob/eac7ac2f4676908b05e746e085c1cbf23d000563/apps/vscode/package.json#L960-L963)).
This explicit enablement is required if you want to use Copilot in your Quarto workflow.

## Current Limitations and Workarounds

### Div Folding Support

Whilst the bracket pair configuration enables basic folding for divs, native folding support in the Quarto extension remains an ongoing feature request.[^folding-issue]
The current workaround using `editor.language.brackets` provides functional folding, though it may not be as sophisticated as built-in support would be.

[^folding-issue]: See [quarto-dev/quarto#670](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto/issues/670) for discussion about native div folding support.

### Applying These Settings

To use these settings in your environment:

1. Open your VS Code or Positron settings ({{< kbd win=Ctrl-, mac=Cmd-, linux=Ctrl-, >}}).
2. Click the "**Open Settings (JSON)**" icon in the top right corner.
3. Add these configurations to your `settings.json` file.
4. Save the file to apply the changes immediately.

Alternatively, you can add these to a workspace settings file (`.vscode/settings.json`) to apply them only to specific projects.

## Conclusion

These settings represent opinionated refinement in my Quarto editing workflow.
They address practical challenges like navigating complex document structures and optimising editor performance.

:::: {.highlight}

The combination of **disabled word wrap**, **visual rulers**, and **div bracket pairing** creates a **more maintainable** and **visually navigable** editing experience for Quarto documents.

:::

I encourage you to try these settings and adjust them to match your preferences.
What works for my workflow might need tweaking for yours, and that's perfectly fine.
The goal is to reduce friction and let you focus on creating excellent content rather than fighting with your editor.

Do you have custom settings that enhance your Quarto editing experience?
I'd love to hear about them in the discussion below.

*Happy editing!*
