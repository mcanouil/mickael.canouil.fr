Below, MathJax logo and text.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## The Question/Problem\n\nSometimes you want to use additional MathJax packages in a Quarto document, such as being able to use `\\qty` from `physics` or upper/lower case Greek letters from `upgreek`.\n\n## The Answer/Solution\n\nThe solution is to load the additional packages in the `include-in-header` key of the YAML header, using JavaScript as documented on MathJax documentation.  \nYou can load several packages at once, as shown in the example below.\n\n\n::: {.cell .panel-tabset}\n\n## Quarto Input\n\n````md\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto MathJax\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    html-math-method: mathjax\n    include-in-header:\n      - text: |\n          <script>\n          window.MathJax = {\n            loader: {\n              load: ['[tex]/upgreek', '[tex]/boldsymbol', '[tex]/physics']\n            },\n            tex: {\n              packages: {\n                '[+]': ['upgreek', 'boldsymbol', 'physics']\n              }\n            }\n          };\n          </script>\n---\n\n$$\n\\rank(\\boldsymbol{\\Upsigma})\n$$\n````\n\n\n\n## Quarto Output\n\n![](assets/output.png){fig-alt='Screenshot of an html rendered by Quarto.
